## Extracting "needs" and "wants" from text

For each group, comments including specified words are selected, and the section of text from the chosen word to the next punctuation mark (,.!?) is extracted for further analysis

### Specified words

#### Needs

* "need"
* "must"
* "require"

#### Wants

* "want"
* "wish"
* "would like" / "'d like"

``` {r}

plotOutput("alluvial_plot", height = "500px", 
               hover = hoverOpts(id = "plot_hover")
               ),
    htmlOutput("tooltip")))

```
