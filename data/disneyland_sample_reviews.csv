392719446,4,"2016-7","United States","Good family park, if you find an empty day. It's a 30 minute to 1 hour wait, plus it's packed!! Ages 3 20 will love it, and some adults too. The rides are pretty and intricate, but slow and not too exciting for someone 38, like me lol. The fireworks were cool","Disneyland_California"
669706763,3,"2019-4","Canada","This is going to be a lengthy review, only because this trip had been planned for over a year. Let's start with the lines. Now, myself and 4 others had planned this trip for over a year, we went Easter long weekend and we already were fully expecting it to be busy. We had a 5 day park hopper pass to be able to get on everything and enjoy both parks fully. The Friday, and Sunday were the least busiest days and the most enjoyable. But, there are lines for everything! Lines to get your bags checked, lines to get in, sometimes lines well past the monorail and took 30 minutes or more and lines for rides of up too 120 minutes or more! These parks are so packed full its impossible to move around. Fast pass is a joke unless you get to them early! Got a fast pass at 10 am and was to come back at use it at 6:30pm! The rides: With the 5 days we did manage to get on everything at least twice. But more often then not Indiana Jones was broken. Space Mountain went down a few times, Splash Mountain went down, Big Thunder Mountain, Incredibles Coaster, pretty much everything was broken at one time or another. Waited in line for 45 minutes for Cars before being given a fast pass and told it was broke at about 7pm, it never did reopen that night. If you only have a day pass or hell even 3 days the wait times and the amount of broken down rides would make it near impossible to get on everything. Food: Maybe I am picky, but my friends agreed it was near impossible to find anything decent here. The Red Rose Tavern wasn't bad but it was fast food and it wasn't exactly cheap or anything to rave about. Odered a burger and it was ready before I was done paying! The Grey stuff was pretty delicious though! I can't understand why the Bengal Barbeque has such great reviews. It cost me $5:50 for a chicken skewer that has 3 little pieces of chicken on it! We did the $30 dinner and Fantasmic tickets with the Hungry Bear resturant and what a joke! You got a piece of chicken and or salmon, Rice with cranberries and peaches in it (yuck!) And a arugula salad with chick peas. It came in a plastic container like something from a cafeteria. The Blue Bayou was the only place in Disney that was absolutely blow your mind fantastic. It is not cheap however it was a splurge dinner. The best food we food was outside the park! Better food and prices! Ot is nice they let you bring in water and food now since a water bottle cost $4.50! The churro stands were really good and so was the popcorn stands. The Wine Country Trattoria in California Adventure was very good! Amazing pasta and wine pairings and we did the World of Color package and we got excellent seats for $50 a person. The shows: Fantatsmic and World of Color are incredible and must watch while your here! Get there early to get good seats and don't be suckered into the dinner and show packages for Fantasmic! The one through Hungry Bear was a massive disappointment! The food was terrible and we were told to get there by 8pm but they had already started seating people way before that! We were sat on the side and were obstructed by lamp post and a gate! We saw Fantatsmic the second night and went early, stood on the bridge and it as a primo spot! The World of Color we did the dinner and show through The Wine Country Trattoria and there the food was fantastic and the seats were right up front! That was a $50 package and that was worth it! Overall I've learned a lot from this experience. I would love to come back but may better select our dates. From reading other reviews though sounds like they over pack these parks no matter the time of year. For how much you pay, the wait times and food are just not worth is. Eat outside the park, get fast passes when you can. Hope lady luck is on your side and the rides aren't all broken down. For how much money they must make the rides are always broken!!It was fun, made some great memories, I guess I just expected more but if felt like a money grab everywhere you turned.

122909903,4,"2012-1","United Kingdom","This was our 3rd visit in ten years and again the park was as magical as ever.On arrival we went straight to park to enjoy the fun. Prior to arrival we had booked tea with the characters. This proved to be a very memorable occasion, with lots of characters coming around to your tables and having lots of fun with the children.The evening Fantillusion parade was something to be remembered forever, however, on other visits this was followed with fireworks which seem to no longer happen.After a long first day we returned to the New York hotel for a good nights sleep.Up early to enjoy our day, visited the Walt Disney studios and more rides in the park.The dream parade was scheduled for 5pm, so we thought this would be a great end to our trip as the Eurostar was due to leave at 6pm.We found a spot at the top of Main Street to wait for the parade which had still not started at 5.20pm. We decided to head for the Eurostar as the parade was never going to get to us in time. As this was only a one night visit we had planned our trip so that the parade would be a great finale to our visit. We left feeling a little annoyed and very dissapointed having not seen one of the biggest spectacles of Disney.","Disneyland_Paris"

The crowds are noticeably smaller as most people with families are consumed with the start of the new school year. Another crowd beater is to arrive early in the day. After lunch, the crowds just keep growing.","Disneyland_California"
301698950,5,"2015-8","United Kingdom","we had tickets for 3 days for disneyland, i dont think i realised just how big this place was! Its huge!!We arrived at about 1pm our first day as we travelled from kent at 4am! we were at the back of the car park but thankfully there are walking escalators all the way which is fab as we were exhausted to begin with!we got into the park and headed straight for food as we were also starving so ate at planet hollywood the food was ok although my kids and husband loved theirs kids had the kids menu which was a meal and pudding and drink for 15 euros and i had the american hotdog! dont have that it wasn the best, my husband had the philly dog which he loved the whole meal cost us 90 euros which is quite expensive but we kind of expected aswell, they also come round taking your photo as a family they are 10 euros which we bought!we then headed for the castle, the queues were long for the rides and i dont mean an hour long more like at least 2!! we took the kids on a couple of rides as they had travelled so well and then we just had a wander around and headed for our room.The next day we got to the park for 9am and got on a few rides as soon as possible as we stayed in a disney hotel we get int ot eh park 2hrs early its not open to the public till 10am it was still really busy though and baking hot! make sure if you go in the summer you have sun cream!The next day we got in for 8am (we are getting earlier!) and did 2 rides in 10 mins! We also had a meal with the characters and im so glad we did this as the queues of people to have a photo with the characters was hours long we sat at the table in cafe mickey and they just come to you! we had mickey, goofy, the chipmunks and eeyore this meal made our holiday to see the kids faces was just simply amazing and we have the best photos! its def recommended to do this although the menu is very very restaurant like there are no chicken nuggets if your kids like that! thankfully ours love a lot of different foods although they turned their noses up at quail eggs! this is something you must book though as it gets full quick! i would also recommended doing it as lunch rather than tea as a lot of people do it as tea and its packed we had lots of empty tables at lunch which meant the characters kept coming round a lot to mess around with the the kids which they loved, our daughter bought a thor hammer earlier and every character picked it up and pretended to be thor which the whole restaurant loved!I did read a lot of reviews saying how expensive food and drinks were, i didnt f8ind this to be the case tbh, we had bought drinkg from home as i read this and was worried so didnt buy any drinks but you could buy a meal for the kids easily for 15 euros including pudding and a drink the adults emnu was expensive unless you go all you can eat which i think   23 isnt so bad yes its more expensive than wing wahs at   15 each but your in disneyland!If you have the option to get in the park at 8am!! then do it as its so worth while we picked our breakfast up on the way and ate it as we walked around and it was so beneficial as the kids got on more rides that day than the whole time we were there! There are plenty of shops for everything! the kids went into the lego shop where you can make 3 lego figures of your own for 7 euros! they loves this, my husband also turned into a kid and bought himself a lightsaber and darthvader hoody! which they took to our hotel for us so we didnt have to carry any shopping around this is free and i thought was a great idea!The parade is an absolute must!! we watched it on our second day as we also read it was a must and omg it was fab the ids loved it and so did i!All in all it was an exclellent trip but as much as i loved it and would highly recommend i wouldn go again i think its more of a one off for us, i would like to do florida next!But the kids have been! prepare yourself for a hell of a lot of walking around as we didnt sit down unless we ate! its exhausting! and it completely hammered it down on the third day!","Disneyland_Paris"

202165911,3,"missing","United Kingdom","I visited with my four year old son over the Easter weekend and we had a really good time. Having visited the Orlando and Los Angeles parks in my youth, this was a trip down memory lane for me with the rides carbon copies of those in the other parks, with the main difference being the French language! There are of course some new attractions, in line with recent Disney Pixar releases.My main criticism would be that park looks and feels a bit tired, nothing that some renovations or repainting wouldn't fix. The food was also exceptionally poor and not cheap. Considering this is France I would not expect the former, if the latter.Lastly, and I guess a sign of the wear and tear, we experienced technical failures on three rides, those being the Big Thunder Railroad which closed the ride for 45 mins (we were nearing the end of the queue but were simply marched out   a fast pass would have been nice for our troubles), and also the Haunted Mansion and Buzz Lightyear rides. I would expect an overall  slicker  experience at these prices.The magic is still there, my son had a whale of a time, but I think Disney needs to consider a temporary closure and overhaul of the park to bring it up to date.","Disneyland_Paris"
284459301,5,"2015-3","United States","Collectively, I have been to Disneyland about 8 times. All of those times have been spectacular and we recently went on St. Patrick's Day (which was adorable). I am 14 and i have gone on every single ride on the park, not including the attractions at Disney's California Adventure. I would highly recommend the Happiest Place on Earth to anyone with children aged 4 and up. Strictly because stroller parking is a pain, and I guarantee that no one wants to hear a screaming child while in Its A Small World. Plus I would say that every single cast member is hard working and diligent. We have never had too much mouth from a cast member and i am glad to say that. I am getting an annual pass in September. All of the face characters (Princesses, Princes, Mary Poppins, fur, etc.) are so extremely nice and talented actors and actresses. Some of the prince's I would say are the sitting image of the real deal. But they are always so kind and generous and love to take pictures.","Disneyland_California"
561624419,5,"2018-1","Malaysia","Location1 hour 30 minute drive from our apartments, outskirt location and it was 10 min drive from the park to LaValle Village , basically you can have fun while shopping!!!Experience Purchase the 2 parks ticket as its really worth it! Make sure you are ready to spend your whole day at the parks as there are many rides for both park that you have to experience which is different from others Disneyland. To avoid disappointment, make sure to check the weather forecast before planning to visit the park as we were caught with heavy rain all of the sudden while playing indoor rides, this cause the management outdoor rides thrills temporarily and everyone have to pack into the cover area while waiting for the rain to stop. I find that visiting the park in January is much more relax as there are not many people as well as the waiting time is between 15   25min max ,what surprise me the most is no Chinese Tourist during our visit there!

167498837,5,"2013-7","United Kingdom","We have been to Orlando so felt a little like we were comparing them all the time but it is smaller than the magic kingdom there but still a great park.The downsides are that food and souvenirs are shockingly expensive but most people are aware of this before they go. Rolls for   10 each and   5 for drinks... wow.We got our tickets as part of the deal for staying in a Disney property and we also got our parking paid. A good deal due to   15 for parking per day and   139 per 2 day ticket.Queues were huge 60 to 90 minutes were common on all the rides so we needed the 5 day tickets we got with the accomodation. Everything was good and the rides were great. Watch what you buy for the prices and remember that queuing for most European countries is a strange idea. They just barge you out the road and take offence when you try to tell them about queues. This may really annoy you after a while, it did with me.","Disneyland_Paris"
333569525,5,"2015-12","Canada","I was very surprised during the first week of December at how busy the park was. The Season of the Force & Disneylands 60th Anniversary were definite draws for me to come to Disneyland, but I had expected the crowds to be much smaller.Disneyland is definitely a great experience, as long as you are prepared for what  moderate  and  low  crowds really mean.Pick your favorites, have a bit of a plan as to what you really want to see, but leave some time for just experiencing the magic that Disney creates.","Disneyland_California"

485298868,5,"2017-4","Qatar","I loved this Disneyland. After being to Paris and Disney World, this was a breath of fresh air (sometimes a little bit hot air) This park is set in the most beautiful back drop. It is like they have taken a chuck of a mountain out and placed a Beautiful Disney park. The castle from a distance with the green Valleys in the back ground and it not being the busiest of parks is is picture perfect. It Has a very cool chilled vibe to this park, never a rush to get everywhere just a nice little walk through green plants, trees and water mist spots.My two girls (6 &4 Years old) were able to get most of the rides apart from two but while my 6year old and her dad went on the Grizzle bear , me and the youngest played next to the blowholes that got you wet (good way to cool down if it's hot) the food in the park was delicious I don't think we had a bad meal. I didn't feel that it was so expensive for the food or the merchandise. We didn't get to meet the princesses due to the face we kept missing them but we get get a little wave from Tinkerbell, which made the girls happy. The shows are wonderful and a must.. the best rides for us was the Grizzle bear mine train and the Mystic manor. ","Disneyland_HongKong"
454407767,5,"2017-1","Australia","Bring my two boys go to Disneyland for very first time, so do my wife and me. Be honest, my boys not really into Disney characters before we came here, they rather go to Legoland instead of Disneyland. However, there is much much more you can see and talk and learn in Disneyland. The boys can't wait to go again. We probably try the big one in Florida next time, further travel for us, fingers crossed they will be ok, 15 hours from Australia to LA is already challenging for them. ","Disneyland_California"
553577042,3,"2018-1","United Kingdom","Went only because we needed to go somewhere to kill tin till our flight that night. Neither of us even like rides. We didn't get there till after 1700. There was hardly any queuing. We decided to try out the rollercoaster. Didn't realise it went backwards. Whilst everyone else were hands in the air me and the Mr were screaming our heads of. Was fun but never again.Also did some sort of boat ride. Never saw any characters maybe once it got dark they don't come out.Personally I don't think it's worth the hefty price even if you go on all the rides. Thought the Disney train was quite cool though","Disneyland_HongKong"
426524271,4,"2016-10","United States","We've gone to Disneyland 23 times this year and each time we had to play it by ear, especially with 2 toddlers. Amazingly there are TONS of rides and things to do for toddlers. Here are some things we found valuable after our experiences this year with a 1 year old and a 3 year old....1) For starters it is most manageable if you have 3 adults for every 2 toddlers while at DL. You will need an extra set of hands especially if you have one that is potty trained and the other one in diapers. It is very difficult to manage DL with 2 toddlers and only 2 adults. A 3rd adult can help wait in line for you, watch 1 of the kids while you need to go buy food or use the restroom, or just need a break. There is so much activity going on at DL, toddlers are curious   so it is VERY easy to lose them if someone is not watching them all the time. A 3rd adult can help when you're trying to take pictures. 2) If you are flying to California and don't want to lug a heavy stroller   rent one from City Strollers. We rent a double stroller from them every time we go   the plus side is they deliver to your hotel!3) Stay at a hotel within walking distance of the park. We stay at the Marriott Courtyard or Marriott Fairfield Inn on Harbor Blvd. It's only a 10 min walk to the park and it is well worth coming back to the hotel for mid day naps for parents AND Toddlers. Use the blackout curtains and everyone will be sound asleep in no time!4) GET UP early and get to the park at least 15 minutes before it opens. It takes a while to get through Disney security, especially if they are at 100% inspections. The gates open before the park opens because there is usually  Magic Morning  hours for people staying at one of the resort hotels. 5) Eat breakfast BEFORE you get to the park so you're not wasting time when the lines are the SHORTEST in the morning. I like to pack oatmeal, yogurt and fruit for the kids in the morning   easy to make before you leave the hotel.6) Go to FANTASYLAND first.... no matter how fast you run... Peter Pan will be the longest wait of all the rides in Fantasyland.. .and it usually stays that way ALL DAY... if it is a  Magic Morning  for resort guests   by the time you get there the line will already be 60 min long. Leave someone in line for you while you take the kids on King Arthur's Merry Go Round.. .because Toddlers don't do well standing in long lines. There is rarely ever a line for Snow White or Pinocchio since small kids are afraid of them. If you  talk  your kids though the entire rides, it makes it bearable for them.7) After a few rides, stop to rest for SNACK TIME. Pack some snacks for your kids in a cooler. DL lets you bring in your own food. Find a space where your tots can roam walk. In the mornings, we like to sit in the table area just below Casey Jr. Train.8) Storybook land Canal boats are also a must. If you're lucky you can ask to have your tots sit on the front of the boat (adults need to sit next to them)9)Take advantage of the Companion or Family restrooms   we've used the ones in Tomorrowland by Autopia, Below the Hungry Bear Restaurant and near the Fairy Tale Theater near Its a Small World.10)Download the Disneyland App to quickly see wait times and show times. You can also link your photo pass to the app. Whenever a Disneyland Photographer takes your family photos, pull up the app and let the photographer scan your QR code in the app to instantly download the pictures to your phone. You can preview them and decide if you want to purchase.11) Ride the monorail and ask if you can ride in the very front. It is a max of 4 people in the front cabin but if there isn't a line for it, it's a great experience.We've done this 23 times this year and it is tiring... there are some days we find that we need to relax a bit so we strongly recommend a glass of wine at Club 33 if you know someone or have membership yourself. If not, the Carthay Circle Lounge in CA Adventure has superior service, excellent food and a full bar for a nice glass of red wine.","Disneyland_California"
339520236,3,"2016-1","Montenegro","Maybe because it was raining day and most space of the park is not covered, so we had a bad experiance, but anyway the prices are realy very high. For price ticket of 75 eur per adult just for 1 day , and 1 park without studio , and few euros less for kid we realy expected much more. I assumed that maybe prices are cheaper if you bookbin advance on internet, but in that moment we couldnt do that. On all atractions most of the time you actualy spend waiting for your turn, the que is evrywhere long. The park as it self is nice and attractive , lots of money invested, but nevertheles it is open all over the year , always full. .so if you compare that entrance ticket for Louvre Museum is 15 eur per adult and this 75 eur , and not to mention food prices...even in some spots inside you can not go if you dont buy food first...I can not say that we didnt have fun..but if i would chose again, i would spent money on some other atractions in Paris and i wouldnt chose again this one.Botom line, you pay for the brend.","Disneyland_Paris"

90683692,5,"missing","United States","It was my second time in Disneyland. First time I was celebrating my engagement and now that my parents came we went again.This time it was raining a lot but it did not prevent us from having loads of fun. Actually, the rain made it different and somewhat memorable.Plus, park wasn't too crowded which made easy to go to the busy attractions quite easy in fact. My mum, who is on her 50's, even cried after the ride in the old replica cars from the main street to the castle. My dad, late 50's, laughed as I can't remember in long time. My brother (26) loved it. We had only 2 days, one for each park and it was enough to see everything we wanted and even repeat some. The money should not be, at all, a concern. After your visit, you will definitely say it was a well spent money. That's because they keep the parks perfect. Landscape and details. A to Z, all is very well done and if we, adults, loved it, I can only wonder how a children will feel like. Extremely recommended!","Disneyland_California"
173458770,1,"2013-8","United Kingdom","We share the views of many people writing here. Disneyland Paris was an absolute shambles when we visited on 20th August. Rides continuously closed. We had five rides close while we were in the queue and with too excited young children it was very upsetting. Two of them (pirates of the caribbean and thunder mountain) we had already waited for over an hour. We were at the park for over 12 hours and went on a total of 5 rides having spent the whole day in lines. The only time we were not in a queue for a ride, we were in a queue for (overpriced, poor quality) food. Disney dreams shattered for all...","Disneyland_Paris"

We went first 2 weeks of July as the Scottish schools are on holiday but the English schools are still in term, this makes a big difference for wait time with rides and general busyness of the park. Kids and adults of all ages will love going to Disney. I think the longest line we waited in was 45 mins but it never feels that long with all that   s going on around you. ","Disneyland_Paris"

After visiting both, I would rather visit the Disneyland parks for a couple reasons:1. Disneyland parks take the best rides from Disney World and put them into two parks.2. The parks are smaller so we were able to ride a few rides twice.3. All hotels are within walking distance to the park.4. California weather.. need I say more!? You never have to worry about it raining like in Florida so you can visit any day, all year long.We spent one day at Disney and one day at California Adventure. My husband and I are both in our mid 20s and we absolutely loved both but I think California Adventure was our favorite.","Disneyland_California"

For July, the crowds were surprisingly small. We never had to wait more than 30 minutes to ride anything (even for Space Mountain & Grizzly Gulch Mine Cars!) We are used to peering over heads to watch the parades due to crowds, but we arrived at the parade route 5 minutes before and had an unobstructed view!! We were there from opening (10am) to closing (9pm) and still didn't manage to ride everything, despite the small queues! The only negative to the day was the heat, however queueing areas all had fans and were mainly undercover. With the opening of Shanghai Disneyland I can see why someone might think Hong Kong Disneyland is rather smaller in comparison, but I would still encourage you to visit. Some of the rides are identical to other Disney Parks (Toy Story Playland), some are similar but have some major differences (Space Mountain has a Star Wars theme) and some are completely original (Mystic Manor is one of my favourite rides and can't be found anywhere else!)All in all, we had a spectacular time at Hong Kong Disneyland. I'll definitely be visiting again!","Disneyland_HongKong"

So we had to leave and come back again.Then once we finally got back in we saw countless people with cameras on selfie sticks which was very annoying, but not as annoying as them not pre telling us before paying that the castle isn   t even visible as they are working on it or something. It was just wooden panels with a castle painted on it so we paid full price for partial access and activities to be available to us.We should have been told as we   d have left the park for another LA holiday and not wasted $300.Disney this is unacceptable and a true disappointment The only good thing was out breakfast in the Carnation Cafe where the staff were superb and the Apple cinnamon pancakes to die for.All in all a very expensive disappointing day thanks to Disney not pre advising people at the gate as to what works were or are being carried out.","Disneyland_California"

By mistake we printed out only two tickets but had electronic copies of all three tickets. We took the RER from Paris. On arrival we noticed our mistake but could not find what to do. Couldn't find any Staff and asked at the 'Travel Agent' desk. We were told to go to the 'Visitor's Relations'. We joined the slow moving queue and eventual got to the desk.

78083282,4,"missing","United Kingdom","Having read some of the horror stories that some unfortunate people had to endure, we were very apprehensive about our 3 day trip to Eurodisney. We were however relieved to find that with a little research, and following the helpful tips posted, we were able to enjoy a relatively stress free 3 days which the children loved.To reiterate the tips that made our stay much pleasanter:  Try to plan your days where possible  Book restaurants for lunch and dinner (the buffets are good options and provide good choices) and eat early or late to avoid the crowds  Take advantage of the early access to the park at 8am if you are staying at the Disney hotels (queues are 5 15 mins in the morning)  Buy water and snacks in the  Relay  store in the train station on your way into the villageWe stayed 2 nights (31 Aug 2 Sep) at the Hotel New York with 4 and 6 year old boys. The hotel was clean, staff friendly and helpful and perfectly located at a 10 min walk from the park. The hotel has an ice rink which was already open, and breakfast and dinner buffets at the Parkside Diner in the hotel were of good quality and provided a range of choices, even for children. I would liken the quality to a standard work conference buffet, so whilst not gourmet, it was perfectly adequate for a short stay, if a little overpriced (we paid 80 Euros for dinner for the 4 of us). Not a very  Disney  hotel which was a welcome relief for us, particularly as our boys are not particularly interested in the characters, but may be an issue if your little ones want access to Mickey & co.I would say that the main selling point of the hotel is its location, and as with all the Disney Hotels, the access to the park at 8am (2 hours before the general public) as we were able to go on all the rides with only a 5 15 min queue (Peter Pan, Buzz Lightyear, It's a Small World, Dumbo), which meant that by lunchtime, we had pretty much done all the rides that we wanted, and could relax over a nice lunch at Plaza Gardens (a good quality buffet in a relative oasis of calm for approx 75 euros for all of us). Having eaten at the Pizza Planet buffet where we paid just over 50 euros for the four of us (adequate choice of 3 pizzas: ham and olive, margherita or beef, pastas with a choice of 3 sauces ( bolognese, tomato or carbonara), with a salad bar (couscous, tomotoes, cucumber, sweetcorn etc) and dessert counter, if budget is not an issue, then I would recommend paying an extra 20 Euros to eat at Plaza Gardens for a good quality buffet with choices including mussels, salmon in white sauce, prawn and asparagus pasta, fillets of beef, pork, chicken, soups, good quality salad bar and dessert counter. In both cases, eating before or around midday meant that the restaurants were quiet. We booked a table at Plaza Gardens through the concierge at the hotel, and were the first to arrive at Pizza Planet at 11.45am.Regarding the park itself, I think the key is to have realistic expectations, to expect some queues and accept that Eurosdisney is all about sharing in the kids' excitement and having family time. We went mid week (Tues Thurs) after the August Bank Holiday, and whilst busy, we did not feel overwhelmed by crowds, anymore than you would at a theme park in the UK.The longest queue we experienced was 45 minutes for Thunder Mountain and the Autopia driving ride, both well worth the wait. Autopia displays its opening time on a plaque (sometimes 10am sometimes 11.30) so head towards it around 15 20 mins before to start queuing as it was very popular. The time passed quickly as we brought a couple of Toy Story card games that kept the boys occupied and engaged, and also loaded up our IPhones with 2 player games. Ice creams and snacks also made the queues less boring for the children. Also, getting on the rides early meant that we had the afternoons to wander around the less popular (and hence less crowded) Frontierland and Adventureland after lunch with an ice cream, and to pop over to the Studios park to see the Moteurs Action Stunt Show at 3.30pm. This show is worth seeing but if you have young children who are likely to be frightened by the shooting and explosions, then sit higher up the stadium as you can feel the heat from the explosions lower down! The Disney parade back in the main park is worth waiting for at the end of the day, before heading back to the hotel.All in all, we had a lovely break and were blessed with good weather, and even my cynic of a husband rediscovered his inner child!Whilst there is truth in some of the less flattering reviews (yes, in the 3 days, we saw a couple of people smoking, came across one queue jumper and some staff who at the end of the summer season probably could use a holiday themselves!) but none of which would prevent me from going and witnessing the happiness and excitement that Disney brings out in the children.Would I go back? Possibly in a couple of years once the boys are tall enough to experience the more exciting rides. I would probably give the US Disney a try first, but for the budget and proximity, Eurodisney proved to be an enjoyable pre school treat for a couple of days.","Disneyland_Paris"

Every little detail is taken into consideration and the little touches such as the music that plays, the shop fronts etc all add to the feeling that you really are in the Disney world.Catching your first glimpse of the castle is an experience for adults and children alike.You won't be able to resist looking through the shops on Main Street USA and admiring the flower displays and topiary. Rides and attractions are divided into the four different 'lands' and there are must see's in all of the different lands. There are some really lovely story rides which are a must for fans of the classics such as Snow White, Pinocchio and Peter Pan. As well as the gentle rides for families and young children there are plenty of 'thrills' for the older children adults.For me, my favourite part of the whole Disneyland Park is the appearance and meeting of characters. There are not many 'random' appearances these days and thankfully cast members not make people queue to see them which is a lot better than the crowded pushing and shoving which used to occur. If you are visiting make sure you pick up a programme on your way in and make sure you know the times for the things you most want to see do.Cast members are all incredibly friendly and helpful. They willingly take photos for you on your camera to save you the price of buying their printed one so don't forget to ask. One definite must see is the parades. Magic On Parade is on daily at 5.30 and was the highlight of my trip, a brilliant way to see your favourite characters and if you are front row you may be lucky and get a high five or an interaction with the characters who are on foot. It is worth getting to your place to watch early because it does get very crowded.Another highlight is Disney Dreams which is on a the park closing time and is absolutely amazing. Again crowds form quickly so get there early. I would whole heartedly recommend this place to anyone of any age! Absolutely amazing place to go.","Disneyland_Paris"

2989807,4,"missing","Germany","Your stay at Disneyland Paris is what you make of it. Go with a good attitude, not during a major holiday like New Years or Christmas, and you'll have a great time. Even if you don't enjoy it, your kids will still have the time of their lives. Once you walk through the main entrance, the magic is there.I've read many negative comments about Disneyland Paris and felt that I should write a short review in their defense. I'm an American living in Germany and visited Disneyland Paris last May for the first time (and then again in July and August). I wasn't expecting much as I hadn't heard that many good reviews on it. My family and I have been to Disney World (Florida) many times and even Disneyland (California) once so I do have a good frame of reference for this review.We booked through a travel agent for our first trip and stayed at the Davy Crocket Ranch. What we discovered was that the cabins are trailers with a wood covering. The trailer we stayed in did require some repair, but it was clean and did have plenty of room for up to six people. It is nice that you have a mini kitchen that you can store food and drinks and even cook to keep the bills down. What was nice about the Ranch was the common area (pool, restaurant, stables, etc...). You can spend a lot of time at the ranch and the kids won't mind. Parking was okay as we did arrive within a hour of opening so we parked near the front. Lines were somewhat long depending on which attraction you went on. The Park was clean, but you could tell that some cosmetic repairs (painting mostly) were needed. Trash isn't picked up immediately like it is in Disney World, but my kids (4 and 10) didn't mind so it was okay. At the end of three days, we enjoyed our selves so much that we bought a year long pass. Hint here, if you decide you like Disney that much and your only in your first or second day there, buy your seaon ticket sooner than later as they take the remaining days off (money) of the ticket that you currently have. Our second trip was more enjoyable and cheaper as we discovered the Holiday Inn, which is considered on the Dsney grounds, but not part of Disney. The nice thing about the Holiday Inn is that you can reserve rooms on line for 60 80 Euro per night for two adults and two children (considered by Disney to be a luxury hotel). The Holiday Inn has been done in a Circus theme and my kids love it. Their pool is okay, but rather small with no slide. The food prices are very high, so we just ate at Disney until we discovered the near by shopping area on our next trip. The Park wasn't as busy this trip so we had the opportunity to go on as much as we wanted as often as we wanted. Spent some time at Downtown Disney and went to the Buffalo Bill Show which we believe is a must see. Lots of fun, good show, and not to bad food. Overall we had more fun on the second trip and saved some money. A do agree with some of the other reviewers that Downtown Disney is mostly shopping, but so is Downtown Disney in Florida.We stayed once again at the Holdiay Inn on our third trip and it was pretty much like the second. You get free parking with your seasonal pass and early admission, so we did maximize our time at the Park early. We also tried to take the train into Paris which worked out okay (the train station is at the entrance to the Disney Park). What we discovered this trip was the mall, which is not 10 minutes away and have some nice (reasonable) restaurants where the entire family can eat for 30 40 Euro. We tried a different restaurant every night during our stay and visited Sealife (also in the mall) which the kids enjoyed (but we wouldn't do it again soon unless we had some bad weather.)We just booked reservations again for next weekend and will try one of the Disney Hotels this time as it is now off season and the rates are more reasonable. We haven't visited Disney during the Winter, so we're not sure what to expect except for some cold, maybe wet weather. Once again, my kids won't mind so it's okay.Some helpful hints:  Buy a yearly pass if you intend to visit more than once. You do get a few perks with your pass (get the dream pass) like 10% off of food, free parking in any parking lot except for the Disney Hotel, and early entrance into Fantasyland.  If money is an object, try and stay at the Holdiay Inn or one of the other hotels on Disney property but not Disney. Try to book on line and save more.  I agree with the other reviewer who said start in the opposite direction when you arrive. Most people go straight to Fantasyland and Main Street. Go straight to Adventureland and you'll have a good half hour to hour with few lines.  Bring your own bottled water and snacks. You can't (not suppose to) bring them in, but you can go back to your car war a snack if need be. Water for a family of four can get expensive at 2 Euro per bottle.  The large restaurants on at the Park and Studios are okay, but very expensive. Plan on 100 Euro per meal for a family of four.  Eat at the Mall (can't think of the name of it, but you'll see it advertised) and hit a different restaurant every night. Much cheaper, large portions, and quick service.  Don't worry about the language barrier if you don't speak French. Almost everyone we spoke with spoke some English.Lastly, go with a good attitude. We've had our share of bad experiences there, but we've also had them at Disney World and Disneyland California. This is our fourth time this year, so they must be doing something right.","Disneyland_Paris"

Save up and spend at least weeks at an on site hotel to get the full experience. Expensive but worth it. Carry a towel with you if you want to ride anything with water involved.

As you walk through the main gates is the biggest Christmas tree you have ever seen and the seasons cheer is spread throughout the park. This place is amazing. After a long flight from Australia we wasted no time to take on the theme park known for being  the happiest place on earth . And to save those in a hurry from reading on. It's true. This place has a certain magic about it that I can't explain   you just have to witness it yourself. Forget the rides, while they are amazing too. The real magic of the park is the shows, characters roaming the streets and the fact that everyone isn't afraid to show off their inner child. Streets are lined with adults (and kids) of all shapes and sizes wearing any type of Disney paraphernalia they can get their hands on. Most choose the traditional Mickey Mouse or Minnie Mouse ears, while others opt for a MadHatter hat or Shrek ears. The rides and frivolity during the day while everything and more that you could ever imagine, Disneyland really comes alive at night. (It's open til 11pm during the Christmas holidays).Maybe it was the Christmas theme, but the fireworks show held at the Disney Castle would have to be one of the best fireworks displays I have ever seen. Not only was the castle lit up like a Christmas tree (a real treat), but the fireworks were perfectly choreographed to the music and as the show came to an end, with  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  playing, fake snow covered the park from snow blowers high above street level.

Apparently, there have been major cutbacks which have affected not only the guests (us!), but the employees too in a big way. We have just returned and are so happy to be home in our clean, comfortable home again. Disneyland Paris is the most outstanding rip off of all times. They lure you in with 'extra' free days at the resort, only to trap you within their gates, offering you nothing but disgusting food (I've had better in hospitals), appalling service and dirty, run down hotel rooms. You are far better off flying to the U.S. and doing it all there   believe me! We couldn't even eat basic McDonald's type food (not that we wanted to) for less than 45 Euros for two adults and two children under 6! But at the end of the day, it's all about the children, isn't it? But where were the characters   I remember going to DL California back in the '70's. I have photos to prove this   on every corner there was either 'Grumpy' or 'Sleepy', Sleeping Beauty or Cinderella, Pooh Bear or Goofy. But no, not in Paris. Hardly a Disney character in sight, and when you did, you had to queue up for ages to have a photo taken with them! I know we all remember things to be so much better when we were kids, but this was such a disappointment   and what an expensive one too.","Disneyland_Paris"

89575662,4,"missing","United Kingdom","Took a 5 day   4 night December Christmas break with wife & daughters (9 and 6). Eurostar from Ashford was a breeze. Disney Express service gets your bags from the train to the hotel so you go straight to the park (& vice versa when you depart). Train is hot & crowded, very poor aircon, so take drinks. We used Hotel Cheyenne. Basic but clean and warm & staff very helpful. Ask for extra pillows straight away otherwise they run out. No tea or coffee facilities in room but kettle hire etc at Reception. Breakfast's a right bun fight if you get the times wrong. We ate everyday at 8.15. By 8.45 they were queuing (or not if your French) out the door. Good continental breakfast & masses of it. Been before so took freezer bags & made rolls at breakfast for lunchtime (otherwise paying 8 Euros for a 6 inch hotdog) Both parks are great. We got 9 inches of snow on the 2nd day so it was really magical. Quite a few things got closed for safety & following days staff had difficulty getting in so some attractions stayed closed. It was bitterly cold throughout so take thermals & layers. Staff worked really hard to open what they could maiking sure indoor shows ran so visitors could get in out of the cold with kids. French don't (sorry, can't) queue so getting to see characters & keeping your place at some of the shows was a matter of determination and bony elbows   a rucksack on the back and lots of turning around seemed to work !! All the rides were great. Age doesn't matter, its Disney, we're all kids !! Suprised you can get onto the Tower of Terror at a height of 1.02m but you need to be 1.40 for Indiana Jones rollercoaster ? PS TofT is mental, my 6yr old was having kittens laughing and screaming at the same time ! We booked 3  events  before we went. 1. Wild West Show. Great entertainment and a meal included. Would highly recommend this as kids had a ball shouting and whooping. 2. Princess character meal at Auberge de Cendrillion. Posh menu, average cooking, cafe level of service   and it wasn't that busy ! Kids meal total trash   dry burger, manky sloppy veg and what was meant to be mash potato (but wasn't ?) you could fit in an egg cup. Only a few characters too. Would NOT recommed this. You can get far better value for money elsewhere. Like .. 3. Character lunch at Golden Nugget. All you can eat buffet. Plenty for kids, pasts, chips, nuggets, chicken, salad. Really tasty selection for adults   Mexican, fish etc     just great. Loads of characters, really friendly staff. Excellent value and kids loved it. (PS Wife says loads of great deserts too !!). Friend with us did Buzz and Woody lunch in Frontierland that was justa s good. Bus transfers between hotel and park take about 100 people and are every 12 minutes. Other than A de C can't say a bad word about the holiday. You can pay more and get a posh hotel but by the time we got back in the evening all the kids wanted to do was crash out. Room TV only has Disney Channel and 24hr news in English but does have scart sockets etc for portable DVD use (need batteries as mains socket a way away). Park prices are typical disney. In Euros expect to pay Coffee 2.5, hotdog 8, small popcorn 5, beer 6, 75cl coke 4. In a  character venue  meal 18 26, beer 6 9 a pint, OJ 4. No free water for kids only 1L bottles.","Disneyland_Paris"

Thinking of that, I would never ever go there in summer time. There were queues absolutely everywhere, either for toilet, food or attractions. The staff at the attractions could  ve been a lot better to put people in the different wagons and so on, there were a lot of half ful boats wagons because people wanted to sit at the front row (!!). We  d expected that there would be characters walking around in the park, but we didn  t see any of them, except at the parade. Also, the attractions were quite poor, especially when waiting time is 30 60 minutes..We  ll never go back, and we won  t recommend to go there if you (and your kids) aren  t up for queues. Although   our 5 year old was very happy, and very patient... The parade was great, and the Disney Dreams at night was absolutely stunning.

Both parks are doable in one day if you get there early and move fairly quickly.

328638855,4,"2015-11","United Kingdom","Visited Disneyland Paris 20 23 Nov 15. This is great fun adventure for adults and children. Both the Disney studios and the Disneyland Park offer fun, laughter and thrills. The Disney studios are newer which is certainly reflected in the standard of the rides. Terror Tower is the best ride in both parks followed by Crush Coaster, Space Mountain, Aerosmith rock n roll roller and Phantom Manor. Unfortunately Thunder Mountain was closed for refurbishment which was a little disappointing. Personally I don't think the French cut the mustard when it comes to the 'Disney Vibe' Americans do the whole 'Disney' thing a lot better   being happy, hyper and excitable just seems to come naturally to the Yanks whereas the French are more stuffy reserved. The park doesn't allow selfie sticks which I think is a little stupid as you can smoke cigarettes in the queue line   Disney you must ban smoking in the park it's disgusting! The food in Disney is beyond expensive, I overheard a coupe of family domestics when the bill arrived. One of our meals my partner and I ordered consisted of fajitas, one coke and a basket of onion rings   it totalled    65 which is about   50 Be savvy when visiting Disney and consider my money saving tips:  Tip 1 :   Purchase tickets in advance   two or three day park tickets work out cheaper. Tip 2 :   Stay at a hotel just outside the park i.e. Dream Castle, Magic Circus etc. These hotels are only a free five minute shuttle   check them out! Tip 3 :   Visit the park on the days it's open until 10pm   more time in the Park   better value for money. Tip 4 :   Go half board in the hotel, that way you can pop back for dinner then head back into the park for more evening fun   you will save a lot of money this way especially when travelling with larger groups and with family. Tip 5 :   Avoid if possible weekends and school holidays. Tip 6 :   Take the Eurostar   the station is literally at the front door of the park. Tip 7:  HAVE FUN!! I would definitely return!

228921982,4,"2014-9","United States","We visited Disneyland on Saturday, September 13 2014 with a 4 and 6 year old to celebrate my 4 year old daughter and husbands birthday. The weather was 98 degrees and lets just say HOT sounds nicer than it felt! Things I did before visiting: Researched weather, mapped out the rides and show times, froze some ice packs for the lunches and bought some Disney gear from Walmart. Items I brought to the park with me: Lunch with drink for everyone (lunchables, sandwiches and foodles), a LOT of water, DSLR camera and backpack, double stroller (some of the time my kids only want to stand in line and for the parade), portable phone charger, character sign books, lanyards, bubbles and froggtogg towels. We got there early and parked across the street at one of the Hotels and then walked to Denny's to eat breakfast. I tried to get the kids to eat a big breakfast so they wouldn't be asking for food in the park. Upon entering the park we went straight to Meet Anna and Elsa but unfortunately by 10AM all the spots were already reserved. We pretty much stayed in Fantasyland and rode a lot of the rides there. We gave the kids bubbles to help them tolerate the lines. By 12PM it was scorching hot so we headed over to Mickey and the Magical Map show (sit towards middle). It felt good to be in the shade so, we decided to take the Disney train which has 4 stops around the park. After we got to the New Orleans stop (right before Mickey's Toontown) there was a  security concern  on the train in front so we would be stopped for an indefinite time. We decided to get off the train and ride Winnie the Pooh. It was just too hot so we bought some Mickey ice cream ($4.50 each by the way) and more water. Once we got back on the train, the kids were hungry so we decided to spend some time in Mickey's Toontown. There is a lot more shade here and lots of places to sit and eat. We also decided to re wet the froggtoggs here because they were starting to become dry and hard. We visited many of the characters because the park was not as crowded today. By 3PM we were ready to go to the parade but decided to swing by Roger Rabbits Car Toon Spin. The line for this ride was over 40 minutes but looked short from the outside. So we hurried over to see the parade and had to stand by it's a small world. This came in handy because after the parade we were able to get on the next boat for this ride. The kids loved the parade so much we decided to go over to California Adventure and watch the Pixar Parade also. Tip: Once you exit Disneyland make sure they stamp your hand before heading over to California Adventure even if you are not coming back over to Disneyland. We found seats on a bench near Disney Jr Live and watched the parade with some popcorn. Unfortunately Disney Jr Live (my kids love this show) had no more showings so we headed over to muppet 3D live after the parade. We watched a little bit of the live shows and rode a few more rides before heading over to our Grand Finale of riding Ariel's Undersea Adventure. Tip: Make sure to park your stroller at the stroller parking area or one of the employees will move it. Also, we left a lot of items in the stroller and nothing was taken however, I do not suggest leaving any valuables in a stroller.By 8PM the kids were tired and worn out so we decided to miss the firework shows and head home. I made sure to have more snacks in the car for the trip home. We had a great time and I plan to create a flipbook so they can see the changes that occur at Disneyland as they age.","Disneyland_California"

But, I decided to go with some friends and had a really fantastic time! We got there right when it opened and the lines were quite short in the morning. We didn't spend more than 20 minutes in a line! The park is small; I was able to go on my favorite rides multiple times throughout the day, with and without fast passes. Because of its size, visiting the park is one day is more than feasible. I personally loved Space Mountain and Grizzly Gulch rollercoasters.The food was not as good as food at other Disney parks. The Mickey waffles and ice cream were tasty, but the popcorn wasn't warm and the sandwiches from bakeries on in Street barely had any meat and cheese in them.

Not only were they not helpful, they were generally uninterested and miserable   not really fitting with the 'magic' of Disney. For example, you would expect staff to be able to point you in the direction of certain hotels or restaurants, but most didn't seem to have a clue and sent us round in circles.I think this is the ideal place to come if you have little ones (less than 5 yrs) and don't want to do the transatlantic thing   but just be mindful it is more of an amusement park for kids than it is 'DisneyLAND'. 2 rides broke down with us on them, and 1 broke down whilst we were in the queue.

We're also EXTREMELY UPSET WITH DISNEY for getting rid of certain acts (i.e. Billy Hill and the Hillbillies   a disgusting way that Disney suddenly let them go after showing up to work one day) in order to cut costs, yet the ticket price keeps going up and up and up. We've also noticed that some of our regular food favorites are changing to cheaper food items (i.e. the salads at Pizza Port are using more iceburg romaine lettuce instead of the nice mixed greens once used in the cranberry walnut salad).

193407772,3,"2014-1","United States","While we enjoyed our time at both parks we like DisneyWorld better. Why do I say this? Please allow me to break it down:Pin Trading: Pin Trading is better at DW, because pretty much every Cast Member does it. There are also a lot more pins to choose from. At DL you buy a starter pack, and you're lucky if you are able to trade out the set before the end of the day. While at DW you end up running of trash pins almost with in the first two hours. We were disappointed by the limited number of people and places to trade pins with. Food: There are more places in DW that are sit down and with food of higher quality, preparation, and nutritional value. DL has a very limited selection. Crowds: DW being bigger and more spaced out doesn't feel, to us at least, as crowed even on high capacity days. DL feel crowded even when the numbers are on the lower side due to the the park being smaller and having more annual pass holders.Cleanliness and Upkeep: I could be wrong about this, but it feels like DW is where all the money goes. DL feels like they just keep it up and running since they already have the park there. Stuff needed painting, noticed some broken stuff, etc.Cast Members: DW Cast Members seem to enjoy their jobs more. Friendlier, more joyfull, and personable. DL CM seemed like dead.That all being said I'll talk about our trip last month. We still had a good time despite. The lines only had at most a 30 minute wait time, and we did get some cool pins. They only thing that really made our trip less enjoy able were the people that cut lines. Several times we would be waiting in line for like 15 minutes or more, and we would hear behind us  Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.  To have the person, or persons more often then not, push there way all the way up the line to meet with a group. I'm sorry, but if you didn't get in line with them. Then they can come to you. It's not fair to the 50  people you just excuse me'ed past. What really grinds my gears if you had enough, and you refuse to let them by then you're the jerk. Seriously!

512391948,5,"2016-9","Australia","We visited Disneyland in Spring, staying at an onsite Disney resort. I had previously thought that Disneyland was a theme park for children, with little to offer for adults or older teens. How wrong I was! This holiday catered for all, no matter your interests or age. We stayed for 7 nights and this was not long enough to do everything that we wanted. You could certainly see both Disneyland and California Adventure Park in a couple of days, but to experience it, and discover all it has to offer needs time. Firstly, this is nothing like the parks we have in Australia. The entire place is themed, not just the rides attractions but every detail of every inch of the park. I was also surprised by how clean and well kept the entire park was. All staff were very friendly and helpful. They also seem to be able to get people onto rides at about three times the speed of our themes parks. This all adds to the magic and feeling that you are truly away from the rest of the world. Rides vary from classic Disney story telling attractions for the whole family, to the more popular thrill rides. My wife and kids loved Peter Pans Flight. I must say though, that even the faster rides are probably not as full on adrenalin spiking as those at other theme parks. So if thrill rides are your sole reason for going, you may be a little disappointed. As you would expect, lines are probably the biggest issue to navigate, so go in off peak times if available to you. Fast pass allows you to reserve a ride for later in the day, but be warned that you an only reserve one ride at a time. So I booked a space on a popular ride at 10am, with my allotted ride time being given as 6pm. This meant I couldn't use my fast pass again until I used it at the 6pm ride. Hope that makes sense. We also made the mistake of not looking at Disney events, and there was a marathon on when we arrived, which limited easy walking access to the park, and added to the crowds.Food is everywhere and caters to all tastes. It was fun choosing where to eat. Our biggest problem was finding food for the vegetarians in the family, so they lived on chips and mac and cheese. They were desperate for some vegetables no covered in sauces. Also, after a week, the idea of mostly deep fried or rich theme park food starts to feel a little sickening, and we struggled to find more simple, healthy options at times.Disney is expensive, but you would have guessed that.Character breakfasts were fun but terribly overpriced. The kids enjoyed a quick photo with popular characters, but this is also available throughout the park for free. The food at the character dining buffet was very greasy with hotdogs, pizza, candy etc all in the breakfast buffet and limited fruit healthy cereal options. With a lot of walking and eating, a simple breakfast would have been preferred to start the day. Also make sure the kids buy autograph books to collect the signatures of the characters you meet, as we were not aware of this activity and missed out on the first day.Staying onsite certainly helped, as we could come and go to our room as we pleased. You also get the early bird entry. All Disney hotels are walking distance. This helps with kids on a long day as the fireworks aren't until late at night. The fireworks were very busy, so get there early. From speaking with staff I understand that lots of locals turn up for this so crowds rapidly increase in size.It is hard to capture this holiday in words, and on re reading this does sound a little negative. The reality is that regardless of crowds, costs etc, this is a magical holiday for all ages. We loved it and want to return at Xmas to see the park all dressed up. We are planning our next holiday to Disney World in Florida later this year.","Disneyland_California"

If you are going to Disneyland Paris then please book tickets for both the parks. We found the studios to be much better than the Disney park.

It is the platonic ideal of a theme park, even more than its counterpart in Orlando.The major negative is that it is almost constantly grossly over crowded. Disney has over sold its annual passports and does not effectively limit sales at the gate. I am not really sure why they do that, because the least crowded areas of the park are food stalls and retail stores. Everything else is so crowded that it really hurts the experience.That said, the Disney Magic is real. The hooks the park has into memories that you have of childhood and are able to share with your own children are amazing.

I am a huge fan of dragons, so to see the one under the castle based off the original fairy tales (it's not Maleficent) was a highlight of the visit. There were subtle differences in Small World, Pirates, and Phantom Manor that only die hard Disney fans might notice, but all of them still fitted seamlessly in the environment. The only ride we missed due to refurbishment was Thunder Mountain. The food choices were as expected and costs translated similarly in Euros what we pay at the American parks. The one major thing we noticed that was different than the American parks was the lack of ears. In the US, we all wear ears all the time. In DLP, we received strange looks from the locals at first, then they asked where we got them. The park had only the basic ear hats headband offerings and very few available at each store.

We didn't get there till lunch time and unfortunately it rained at 8pm and all the rides were shut down and fireworks were cancelled.My 4 year old LOVED the parade and was the highlight of her day. She was dressed as Anna from Frozen so the princesses on the floats blew her kisses when they spotted her which a month later she still gushes over when she retells the story to people. The food was very expensive and service was quite slow but it was good quality. Our pram got a flat tyre while we were there and a kind lady in the wheelchair hire desk pumped it back up for us; all the employees were very kind and helpful.Queues were extremely long so we only managed 6 rides in the time we were there. Definitely recommend at least 2 days.","Disneyland_Paris"

Our kids are 12,10 and 5 and they really liked the attractions. Restaurants offer mainly Asian food but pizzas and burgers can be found too. If you visit the park during the rainy season, bring your rain poncho or buy it from the park (kids size 60 HKD). Fireworks in the end are worth of seeing. ","Disneyland_HongKong"

In comparison, the Hong Kong Disneyland is small and somewhat limited. Food option are less exciting and rides and attractions are smaller and less in quantity. Merchandise were expensive (as expected) but also limited compared to Tokyo's one. This time round, there were less people so it was at least more enjoyable.  Disney Paint the Night  was my personal favourite. Fireworks is at 9pm which is rather late but if you are on holidays you can perhaps afford to allow the children to stay up late. Don't try to prepare your day by using any information they provide online because the online information is just not up to date. A bit frustrating to have planned our day according to their information just to find that the plan was not going to be helpful. We recommend if you wish to stay for the fireworks to arrive just before noon so you have enough energy by the time the fireworks start. If you intend to go to Ocean Park and Disneyland, there are some discount for purchasing both park tickets if you hold a foreign passport. It worked out to be a saving of $99 HKD for adult and $59 HKD for child","Disneyland_HongKong"

They have two leaflets that are helpful: the Guide Map and the Times Guide. From these two, check which you like to visit, check the time sequence, and then plan accordingly. Just walking around the whole compound will take less than an hour. But stopping at shows, activities, meals, etc. may take a long time. With visited end of August and the queues ranged from 5 minutes to 20 minutes, but most were short. For small kids, the Jungle River Cruise is interesting. Mickey Mouse and the Wondrous Book was a good show, with high tech effects. Be ready for a lot of walking.

613999698,4,"2018-8","United Kingdom","Returning with 2 of our Grandsons we flew out to Paris CDG with some excitement. (In between we have done Florida several times). Airport to Magic Shuttle is relatively straight forward however the Magic Shuttle did then commence dropping off at the non Disney hotels before Disney hotels and the Sequoia being the penultimate drop. (Maybe next time we would get a private transfer). Cases dropped and straight to the park   we were surprised at the park staying open until 11.00 p.m. and a little disappointed that the Fireworks did not go off until 11.00 p.m. as we anticipated and found out our 4 & 5 year old Grandsons could not last the pace until then. The 1000m walk from the hotel to the parks was flat and easy. We were surprised how busy the Parks were   at some points during the day places became near gridlocked. In the evenings the earlier closing Studio Park (8.00 p.m.) pushed Visitors back into the Magic Kingdom. One disappointment is the big sell by Disney of hotel guests accessing the park an hour early, yes but for the main rides that just means joining the queue before the ride opens a public opening time. Around the park beverage outlets were all single manned so even at this point in meant more queuing! Although it is a no smoking park with designated smoking areas there are many smokers ignoring this   as a child centred venue I would recommend total no smoking and leave the park to an externally located chimney. From previous visits the number of shows has diminished which means you get little time (rides excepted) to sit down   on your feet all day. Come our 2nd full day we resorted to hiring a stroller as our Grandsons were walking on empty. Great time had, could be improved with restricting numbers in the park, opening all rides when Guests arrive, double manning kiosks at peak times, firework show alternate nights at an earlier time for the little ones. Yes we are planning to return once more before we take them on the big trip over the pond when they are older and can last 2  3 weeks of fun.","Disneyland_Paris"

287375757,5,"2015-7","United Kingdom","I went to Disneyland Paris with my 2 children aged 8 and 9, it was prefect in every way! It helps when your kids are at that in between age, young enough to enjoy the magic of characters and themes, and old enough (and tall enough) to enjoy the bigger rides  roller costers. We had so much fun, I honestly smiled every bit as much as the kids. We didn't get to met any princess's but did see them at the parade, most of the other characters had long queues of little ones waiting to see them, so we decided best to give it a miss, this could be an issue for some people, my advice go early they only hang around for an hour and half. Wear comfortable shoes there is lots of walking. Take a packed lunch!! There is very little choice other than fast food and it is expensive. There is lots of places to refill your water bottles, plenty of toilets which were very clean, even at busy times and great little ice cream carts dotted around..... All the essentials. Staff are super friendly and helpful. If avaliable get the fast passes it saves you having to queue but the queues do move quickly anyway and generally your waiting less time than the rides say. I do recommend you try Planet Hollywood in the Disney village, great service. Don't pay the money to stay in a Disney hotel there are plenty of great hotels near buy most with free shuttle buses, just do your research. My advice to anyone planning to go is, just enjoy yourself, no need to be an adult in disneyland!","Disneyland_Paris"
393022356,3,"2016-6","United States","To be fair, we've visited DisneyWORLD a number of times and were told by many people that the two do not compare. Those people were correct. Disneyland seemed more like a Six Flags theme park with a little bit of extra  umph.  Much of the parking lot was closed and we had to park quite a distance away from the parks. Fortunately, our hotel was within walking distance of a shuttle that had little to no wait. Lines in the morning weren't bad at all however, after lunch, you could barely walk through each  land.  Planning & coordinating the use of the Flash Pass system was an absolute must! I think the biggest disappointment was the customer service. Employees were not  on set  at all times and we often saw them walking through the park with snacks and lunch. While trying to corral visitors in to sections for the nighttime parade, employees were rude and abrupt. It seemed like every time we caught a character out and about for photo ops, we got in line just to be told they were done with visiting and had to come back later. (this literally happened 11 times!) Overall, the kids had fun and our 4 year old didn't know any different. He thought it was magical and so I feel we got our money's worth.

We did the princess experience package for the g daughters and it is so worth the money. It made fantasy land remarkable. They got their hair and nails done. You can add a hair piece or have it done up in a bun with glitter on. Whatever you want. Pick whichever outfit you want to wear for the day. Priority meet for photo shoot with some of the characters.....eg Snow White, Cinderella.There are so many staff to attend to the children and you get to keep the outfit, makeup etc. It made fantasyland seem real. Then after leaving that area whenever you see a character anywhere in Disneyland you don't have to que or be told come back at another time to have photo with them(which does happen). All the parades are worth waiting for. Being summer expect queues everywhere. We got a 3 day pass and it was needed to get around everywhere.","Disneyland_California"
194920419,3,"2014-2","United States","We selected a week in February that according to several websites is a slow week. This may have set our 'expectation gauges' regarding lower crowds unrealistically high. It was packed. Neither of us had been since we were 18 19 yrs old  which was 20 years ago. I recall the rides being more exciting  which I guess in 1992 they were. I visited Universal Orlando the same week last year while on a business trip. The rides were awesome. Fast roller coasters, cool Harry Potter castle ride, Hulk roller coaster, Spiderman ride, Simpsons, Minions and so on. DL did not compare. At all. And don't try to tell me it's about the  magical experience  because there is nothing magical about over priced food, boring rides with long lines and people elbowing one another through lines and crowds. Firstly, I could not believe how small it was. That is not necessarily a bad thing  except when it is massively crowded. The thoroughfares are ridiculously cramped and not suited to accommodate large crowds  why can't Disney do more to control capacity so the experience is a better one? This led me to believe the almighty dollar was more important than providing an outstanding experience that would be well worth the money spent.  Stroller Parking  was EVERYWHERE. Being the proud parent of an 18 month old, I seriously question the logic of bringing toddlers and babies in the park. From my observations  which on  mommy mode  are hyper aware  that just did not look fun for the kids or parents. Screaming crying children and frazzled parents abound. Parents yelling and yanking on their kids, pulling them into corners and scolding them. It made my skin crawl. I suspect if not so many people were permitted to enter, everyone's moods would be better tempered.Back to the rides...Indiana Jones was being constructed the last time we were there. We were so excited to go on it. While Indiana Jones is 10 times the movie as The Mummy, The Mummy ride at Universal is 10 times the ride. That was disappointing. While it was fun to see Star Tours updated with recent film references, it still felt outdated as a ride experience. I loved all the kiddie rides  Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, etc.  those encapsulate my childhood memories of the park and are so nostalgic, however; as an adult, the park is totally lacking in thrill. The food is nondescript and stupid expensive. I can't wait to take my daughter  when she's 5 and requires no stroller. That may sound odd after my review. Disneyland is a rite of passage to a certain degree. I'll just know to select an even  slower  time  including if that means she misses a few days of kindergarten. What can I say except to try to find a time that's not busy. I really feel  aside from the mediocre rides  that our experience was defined by the fact it was simply too crowded to move about freely and enjoy. Fast passes are great, but not when they dictate your park experience.","Disneyland_California"

3353092,4,"missing","United States","We were at Disneyland on Friday 4 8 and at California Adventure on Saturday 4 9. We got in at 10:30 and there was about a 5 minute wait to go thru the bag inspection tables and another 5 to go thru the turnstiles. A friend of ours already bought us the SoCal 2fer tickets and so we didn't have to line up for tickets. By the way, we are not from SoCal but our friend was. Apparently they only check IDs when they sell the tix but not at the turnstiles because we got in without anyone checking to see if anyone in our group was from SoCal. By the time we got in, the park was teeming with people already. I had planned to go to the Winnie the Pooh ride first thing, but a character sighting derailed that plan. Because of our late entry and judging from my son's reaction to the park so far (it was our first time at the park) I realized I had to ditch my well researched plan (I researched many internet sites and more than a couple of guide books for this trip) and just  go with the flow.  Next stop was the Dumbo ride. We waited for almost 45 minutes to get on, but it's a good first ride for preschoolers. Dumbo was a familiar character and the ride is really easy to take and gave my son a sense of control (since he could make Dumbo fly higher or lower) over the situation. After that my son warmed up more to the idea of getting on the rides than meeting characters. So we did a couple in succession   Pinocchio's ride (not worth waiting in line for), Gadget's roller coaster (exciting enough ride for preschoolers but not too scary for protective moms). Then we watched the Snow White show which was a good break from all the walking and standing in line. Before we went on the rides we got a FastPass for Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters. And so by the time we finished the 2 rides and the show, it was close to our FastPass time. We squeezed in a quick lunch at that eating area in Tomorrowland and was pleasantly surprised with a Buzz Lightyear appearance. I think he's there most times of the day for about half hour appearances and then he takes a break and comes back again later. The Astro Blasters ride was a blast. It was the best ride according to my son (who's 4). At the end of the ride, I got to email a picture of us and our scores to my home email account. It's a great souvenir. We went back to our hotel (HoJo across the street   will post another review for the hotel by itself) for an afternoon nap. We went back to Disneyland around 7pm via the ART (cost us $3 roundtrip) and this time we needed to wear light jackets as the air was getting quite chilly. We went on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and the lines were moving quickly because people were flocking to the waters' edge to save their seats for Fantasmic (yes, it was 2 hours away but the roped off areas were filling in fast). My son realized he needed to use the bathroom just as we were about to get on the boats and the cast member was kind enough to let us use the bathroom and come back thru the exit and not wait in line again. The ride was too scary for my son (he doesn't like spooky noises and the ride starts off with that) although he wasn't bothered by the 2 sudden drops in the ride. When you exit from the ride, you enter a replica of New Orleans' French Quarter which was neat for someone who's been at the real place. As we exited from that land, Fantasmic was just starting and we managed to squeeze into a spot near Tarzan's treehouse where I made my son stand on the fence giving him a good view of the show. Tarzan's treehouse itself was blocked off. He called it the Magic Mickey show because the lights, sound, and holographic effects were just awesome. He wanted one last ride and I made him choose between Winnie the Pooh or Buzz Lightyear. He chose Buzz and patiently waited for almost an hour in line just to get in. By this time it's already close to 10pm and the lines are still that long. So if you can get FASTPASSES to this ride, do so. By the time we exited, there was hardly anyone along Main Street most people were staking out their places for the 2nd Fantasmic show. By the way, I was surprised to see that Disneyland is dark at night. I didn't get to appreciate the buildings and other sights because apart from the streetlights and the lights from the shops and entrances to the rides, there was not much illumination. However, there were still a few characters milling about and we got some photo ops with Pluto and Chip n Dale. The next day, another late start for California Adventure. This time you could tell that the locals were out in full force. So much more people than Friday, more kids and teens and less  tourist y  people looking at maps and looking like they were lost. I made a beeline for the Soarin' over California FASTPASS station. We were there around 10:45 and our FASTPASS time was already for 1:35. In between we caught mostly shows in the Hollywood area. Muppets 3D was fun for my hubby and I because we recognized the characters from when we were growing up watching the Muppet Show. It was fun for my son to experience the 3D effects. After that we caught the Aladdin show which was awesome! They even had Aladdin riding an elephant around the Orchestra section. If you sit on the Orchestra, you see the  parade  up close and you're closer to the stage. If you stay on the Mezzanine, you get to see Aladdin and Jasmine and then later the Genie closer as they soar in their magic carpet ride. Along the way to these shows, we saw the lion from Jojo's Circus and also Mr. & Mrs. Incredible; a Disney princess was there too but my son wasn't interested. There wasn't any signs indicating they were going to be at a certain place, it was all by chance. We had lunch at the Burger station served by McDonalds at Paradise Pier. The meals were about $2 more expensive than they were at regular McD's outside of Disney. Then my hubby and son rode the Zephyr which was on again after an earlier period of time when it was closed down. There was no reason posted why it was closed earlier. This ride lasted maybe a minute, if at all. Not worth a long wait. We walked to Bug's Land where they rode Heimlich's chew chew train which amused my son. Again, a very quick ride. But maybe worth the wait for it's cuteness factor. Bug's Land by itself is a  cute place  so definitely worth a visit for preschoolers. We also got on the bumper cars shaped like one of the characters in the story. By then it was past the time for our Soarin' FASTPASS. But apparently, as long as you come after your designated time, you can still get on the FASTPASS line. So even though our time was set for 1:35   2:35, at 4pm they still let us on the FASTPASS line. There was also a singles line that seemed to go as fast as the FASTPASS line. That was another awesome ride. Although I'm afraid of heights and get queasy pretty easily, the special effects of the ride was enough to distract me from my queasiness and I actually enjoyed it. My son liked it so much he wanted to get on again. But at this time, the standy line was going to take over an hour before they could get on the ride, so no way was I going to stand that long. We had another event to go that night and so that was the end of our Disney visit. Although I didn't follow my detailed plans, I still ended up enjoying the trip. Everyone else was right in saying that one day is not enough to experience ALL of Disneyland or DCA, but if you're willing to skip some attractions and be spontaneous about what you can do, the visit will still be fun and memorable.","Disneyland_California"

I had my husband's soup and it wad very rich and creamy, not watery at all! I can't say if their food was good or not as they both ate every bite before I could taste it.

531633833,2,"2017-10","Germany","First let me preface my review by saying that my granddaughter was somewhat happy with her experience. However, being fortunate to have visited Disney World and Disney Tokyo, Disney Paris pales in comparison. The park in many places is run down and in need of a good paint job and wash. Several of the restrooms we used were in very poor condition   very unsanitary and dirty (I pointed this out to several employees and pushed the little  unhappy face  upon my exit). I am a retired military individual and have had to seek mother nature many times in a great variety of locations; some of the Disney restrooms were in worse condition than in some of the worlds ravaged places I have encountered. We spent four days in the two parks and at any given time 25 to 30% of the rides were having  technical problems  (these words must be taught to all Disney personnel because they are used frequently). The real frustrating part is when you are within a couple of feet getting on the ride and then to be told the ride is down because they are experiencing technical problems   this was more the rule than the exception. I will not belabor anymore of the problems we encountered, but I will say that I would have a very difficult time looking at myself in a mirror in the morning having GOUGED the public with the inflated prices for food, drink, and souvenirs.","Disneyland_Paris"

We were tempted by both time and money to try again ...... & I am glad we did. Our first visit was a little shock to the system, being frequent Disney USA travellers. Disney is Disney ... but the French will ever be American!!We travelled during the half term break in October and there are good points and bad points from our experience last year;Good points:1. The queues were not as long for food or the rides (although Peter Pan was never really below the 45 minute mark);2. Themed for Halloween, which made it a little more special (we liked playing spot the pumpkin);3. Although a no smoking park   some nationalities are still not used to being told when and where to smoke ... but this was without doubt, more controlled than last year;4. The new layout of the Disney Village (1 security check) was far better;Bad points:1. Parts of the park are closed for half of the week (being  out of season ); Small World, Caseys Train and Fairytale Boat ride were closed from Tuesday through to Friday ... if we knew this, we would have made more of this area before the end of Monday ... there should be more awareness around closure of rides!;2. The rides that should have been open for disney hotel guests who benefit from extra disney hours were not open when we went ... Snow White & Pinocchio were closed, and Buzz, Peter Pan were broken ... which left only 3 rides open during the 2 extra hours ... and you guessed it the Queue's for those were long! 3. Toilets were better cleaned, although those near Peter Pan are still awful (and we went in two sets of different womens toilets and found men in there (odd)!On the day of our little boys birthday, we were advised to go to City Hall and inform them that it was his birthday. He was treated to a personal call from Mickey, and a birthday gift of wither a Traders Pin, Balloon or an Autograph Book ... what a special thing to do!Prices are controlled, (still disney prices) but not really any higher than last year!All in all a good break and being back a day ... we are already planning Christmas at Disney for 2013!","Disneyland_Paris"

Most were only children family, which were appropriate as a family theme park. The Pinocchio ride was, for example, not exciting at all. Yes I love Pinocchio, but it was a pretty boring ride.

Make sure you pay for a ticket to get you through the last gate to Disneyland entrance!!! I can't express this enough. (French scam as far as I am concerned). They don't warn you or put poster up to say. Myself I had pre booked my train tickets with Paris pass. I had researched I probably had to pay 5 6 euro to get a ticket at final extra gate. My train ticket worked all way to the Disney park no issue so I assumed I had done really well in my plans. Oh no no no. They fine you on the final gate!!! Charged 36 euro for me to go through a final train ticket point .... Disney entrance was 100 meters away. And that was only because I had a valid ticket that said ha ha ha. Raging was a word is use. If you had a invalid ticket it's much worse!!Get tickets and ask at information booth before stepping foot towards there. It's not hard but it's robbery and they do it for money pure and simple.Disney park   Well onto the park. Two parks available studios and Disney world. Both have a good all round set up for kids. Studios   I would recommend tower of terror and stunt show with Cars and bikes fire and stunts. Few kids rides in there and a huge play area which kids love. Not a very big park so easy to get round. Disney world   Bigger park this one. I recommend the main ride space mountain. Good all round set up for kids. Good bar street outside parks with shops and food places. Wild West show is next to cinema outside parks with dinner. Pricey though at 68   78 euro.Overall if you have kids and are going France then great or taking your partner.

255113319,5,"2014-9","United States","I will admit, I'm a die hard Disneyist, one that visits the DLR (Disneyland Resort) annually for at least two full days of fun & sun, and for my dose of Disney reality. to me, it is a place where I find solace away from the harshness of life, and where my inner soul can be free again. My last visit did not disappoint   other than the park closing early due to a Disney employee event at the park. No matter, it was a quiet & somewhat peaceful day in the park, with light crowds & beautiful weather to boot. Almost every attraction was up and running, including the Halloweentime overlays on both Space Mountain & Haunted Mansion; while the former (known as Ghost Galaxy during Halloweentime) is truly an epic set of special effects & sounds, the latter (known as Haunted Mansion Holiday) disappointed again this year. Personally, the Haunted Mansion should not be touched for any reason; the overlay looks cheap & unappealing, the music is out of step with the ride, and in all reality: Unless you've seen  The Nightmare Before Christmas  it makes NO sense. This is one recent tradition that the park can do without. Dining for me this day was a wider array of food & treats in the park. Pizza from Redd Rocket's Pizza port, in addition to the usual suspects of Churros and popcorn, made for a tasty day. For what people complain about Disney prices, in all reality they are often cheaper than what SIx Flags or Cedar Fair charge for similarly sized items. Still, it isn't a Burger King or other fast food pricing, but it does taste good, the food is served right, and the prices are fair for the fare. However, there is one treat that is well worth the price paid... and then some: The most incredible treat in all of the Land is a Dole Whip. You can't eat just one...or six...or nine...All the attractions I rode during my trip were not only operating well, but had the usual Disney level of quality staffing. Minor glitches did crop up along the way, and Disney solved them perfectly along the way. I was able to complete the Mountain Run early in the day   All four mountains   in a new record of 21 minutes, 33 seconds, besting my old record by nearly 20 minutes. Light crowds made just about every attraction less than 10 minutes wait time, including the most popular rides such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain & Splash Mountain. ADA accessibility has changed since my previous visit, to a new system which works VERY well if you think & plan ahead. The DAC system however is being revised again, be sure to keep up with information on your trip planning well in advance. Also, as always, Disneyland's attractions are known to be SWARMED by locals on weekends & Friday nights   if you are ambulatory handicapped, be prepared to be knocked around pretty hard. Two near miss accidents for me and I retired for the night to my inn across the street. It should also be noted that during certain events & parades getting around for the able bodied can be difficult   and 10x worse for the handicapped. Planning out to be away from these mass crowds is to be advised, and to get into position away from any parade routes will save you time & frustration. As always, the park is beautifully maintained, and as the park transitions into the Disneyland 60th celebration, it will become more so. I look forward to my next visit to the resort in the summer of 2015, and to many future visits as well.","Disneyland_California"

I recommend others to purchase 2 3 days park ticket rather than just 1 day ticket given that you won't experience all the attractions in one day considering there's too many rides. We spent 2 whole days in Disneyland and didn't even experience all the rides they have to offer. Also, you could imagine how busy the park is, especially during Summer Holidays so I suggest getting a 'By Pass' to overtake that long Que awaiting you turn whereas when you have the bypass you have that advantage of even going on the rides 2 or even 3 times the limit you wouldn't have experienced waiting in the normal line.

The park is quite small, but there was still more than enough to do to keep ourselves entertained. Whilst the castle was under renovation they have erected essentially card board to maintain the external appearance which to me looked very tacky. If you want to see the parades (which I highly recommend) get there early so you get a good viewing point and beware the locals can get a bit pushy.

199770830,4,"2014-3","United Kingdom","There are good and bad points but generally my experience of Disneyland Paris was really good.We stayed at the New York Hotel, we took advantage of the magic extra hours a few mornings which are from 8am to 10am. I come to my first negative, there are not a lot of rides open during this time. Staying and paying the price of staying at a Disney Hotel I feel we need more benefits and get more access to rides and different areas of the park. In the extra hours, the only areas that are open are Fantasyland and Tomorrowland, but not all the rides are open. In Fantasyland, the rides that are open are Le Carrousel de Lancelot, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Mad Hatter's Tea Cups and    it's a small world   . In Tomorrowland its, Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast, Orbitron and Space Mountain. So not much is open. You could do all these rides before 10. But the good thing about being in the park early, is that when the rest of the rides do open at 10am, you can be there ready to get in the queue before anyone else. We couldn't do this as we choose our breakfast slot for 10.30 so we could make the most of the extra hours and not have to be up super early and then go back and have breakfast. But there is a 7am breakfast slot.The parades are brilliant, thats one thing Disney do best. I was disappointed that I didn't see Merida, but yet the Princesses from Frozen where there. But I hear that Merida will make her first Disneyland Paris appearance this spring summer.I didn't see that much characters around the park, could have been because we went back for breakfast and weren't back in the park until about 11.30 and where on rides most of the time, rather than wondering around the park, so possibly missed their appearances.The night time Disney Dreams show was amazing! Disney knows how to put on a show. The fireworks and the projections onto the castle with the music was just amazing! The queues for the rides where surprisingly short, going in March I think was a good decision as it was off season. The longest we have to queue for any ride was Thunder Mountain, which was 45 minutes and then it broke down and closed so that was a bit disappointing but nothing can be done about that, and they gave us fast passes for that evening. But everything else in the park was a really short wait. We didn't need fast passes for anything in that park.The only thing that really angers me about queue though is people that budge the queues. We were really lucky as it didn't happen that much to us, and we did hear a lot of stories about the French cutting the queues. We did have some incidents in the space mountain queue and thunder mountain. But the park is great for all ages, not a lot of big rides but Disneyland is aimed for kids. And brings your inner kid out of you. Everyone is running around excited, wearing silly hats and minnie mouse ears and just having a great time. Space Mountain is got to be one of the best rides there. Compared to the one in Florida, the Paris one is much better, as it has loops and goes much faster.The only bad thing about going at March time is that a few of the best rides were closed for refurbishment such as Indiana Jones and Peter Pan's Flight and some of the rides in the other park were closed too which was disappointing but I did know this before I went.But a part from the bad points, my generally experience of the park was very good. A lot of the staff were very nice, you do get a few rude and unhappy ones, but a lot of them were very helpful.I do like Florida better as its better and has more parks, but Paris is easier to get to and I still had a great time. I will defiantly be going back.","Disneyland_Paris"

Beware of exchange rates on the park, whilst we visited it was less than a euro to the pound.

The crowds weren't outrageous and the lines were almost all in the sub 30 minute range. And all the charming little attractions that have been disappearing from the Magic Kingdom still exist   Pinocchio's Voyages, The Dragon cave, Alice's curious labyrinth, Storybook land, Casey Jr, and many others were all amazingly fun. And it was great to see the 'European' take on the US expressed in rides like the Phantom Manor (Haunted Mansion) and Small World.On the negative side no one warned us that the park was closed. Not officially...just a whole bunch of the rides were shut down. Worse, because of all the renovation work we were fighting a constant battle trying to get where we were going   time after time our path ended in an newly constructed cul de sac. Yet worse still, many of the food locations and most of the food and drink carts were shuttered. Which brings me to...On the unbelievably, gobsmackingly, inconceivably horrendous side was each and every aspect of the food and beverage service at Disneyland Paris. I had read reviews of the food being awful and discounted them   after all, we've visited amusement parks, zoos, waterparks, beaches, national parks, and many other tourist destinations around the world and faced the concessionaires in all of them. This was soooo much worse that I really don't know where to begin. The truly disgusting hot dog and fries at Casey's corner that we left largely uneaten? The lunch line that I waited in for a half hour which closed when I was two people away from the cashier? The surly waitresses at the Lucky Nugget who needed to examine our receipt for every course while spilling both a drink and a dessert on us? The quality of the fish and ribs there that left my family feeding off the two burgers we ordered? Or the 40 minute wait to buy an ice cream? All I can say is eat a very hearty breakfast, plan on leaving for dinner, and do your best to find something edible in between.","Disneyland_Paris"
161652372,5,"2013-5","United States","I have been an Annual Pass Holder for more than 12 years and can honestly say that I have NEVER had a bad time at Disneyland. Of course the assumption is its for the kids, and while your kids can come and enjoy the park its not exclusively for them, in fact after 6:00pm if you take a look around, most of the babies are gone or asleep and its for a more grown up set. GREAT FOR DATE NIGHT! Here's why, Disneyland is lit very lovely in the evening, soft and ambient, fireworks at 8:45pm. The lines to the rides allow you and your date some time to chat it up before enjoying an  experience , will it be the darkness of Pirates of the Caribbean or snuggled close in the Haunted Mansion? Your choice, they are all good. There are several great choices for a REAL dinner with REAL drinks! Sit and listen to a live Jazz band in New Orleans Square and sip your mint juleps over healthy portion, or enjoy dinner on the lake in the Blue Bayou restaurant. Want something more upbeat? The 1980's band Diva Trip at Tomorrowland Terrace is seriously good! Over at California Disney they offer wine tasting and the Drink Me bar at the Mad Hatter night club has dancing a live band, a DJ, beautifully done. Best Long Island Iced Teas anywhere. If you are looking for an upscale dinner and are not a member of Club 33, the seafood and drinks at Carthay Circle are not to be missed! Downsides, there ARE families there, but if you have a family, you'll be able to appreciate the luxury of NOT being saddled with the kids and be able to enjoy your drinks, and ambiance and the luxury of not having to be rushed. Take your time and enjoy this lovely  park  its cleanliness, great food and music, cool evening ambiance and enjoy the  fireworks ! Be a kid again :)","Disneyland_California"

Children aged between 3 & 10 should not be made to queue in the hot sun to see a princess. A parent told me she queued for 2 hours!! We gave up and on the second day made sure we were there early!! In such a huge park, the characters should be walking around a bit more & there could be 2  3 sites where you can meet a princess ie have your photo taken. Some of the rides were not open and a few had  technical problems  so after queuing for over an hour we couldn't use. There is little communication between both parks, so you have to keep walking back and forth   say if a ride in one park is not working and you want to use that time to queue for another ride in the other park. The attendants were not very helpful. Also, we had breakfast with Mickey   kids got to see the characters, but really disappointed with the restaurant and the staff. Thought that everybody in Disney was supposed to have a smile on their face? Do we really need to have full view of a functioning kitchen? For the price, this could be better.

So for those in a similar predicament to me I can tell you it's not all bad. It's easy to reach via the MTR and compared to other theme parks the lines and entry isn't too bad. We managed to fit in about 5 or 6 rides in about 5 hours of a visit. The more popular rides expect a wait of up to 50 minutes or more. You can buy an express pass though and that allows you faster access to rides. The Disney classic rides were very popular but we found the old western area pretty quiet and the rollercoaster there up with the better rides in the park.

We had as much fun here as we would have In Disney World. While Disneyland is not as large there is still plenty to keep you busy. There is a lot less walking involved here because of the smaller park size. You can get in all the rides but not all the shows in one day so make sure to plan three days if you do both parks.

499754446,4,"2017-6","United Kingdom","I thought I would do another review of Disney as its the last time I will be visiting (Unless I have to take any future grandchildren, that looks to be years off yet). My little girl loves the place and we have been five times out of the last six years. But as the title says I'm all disneyed out!Its very hard to knock the park as it can be a real happy frustrating place. You start off all excited and then have moments of sheer frustration throughout the day. then its all topped off at the end of the day with the firework and end show spectacular. And then you leave thinking  That was awesome . Firstly some of the bad points. Disney do not care if the park is absolutely mobbed and you have to queue for hours for a ride, I've been six times and I've seen the extremes from it being near empty, to absolutely rammed. You need to do your homework and make sure you DO NOT go on a french holiday time. Our last visit there was my mistake for booking it in French school holidays. We entered the park at 9 30, as they will allow you to enter before the advertised opening times. But all the sections are closed until 10 00 they have park employees manning the chains until the stroke of 10, then they let the chains down, and thousands run to the rides like its their last ever chance to ride them. We went to Thunder mountain immediately and within 5 minutes of arriving there. the queue time was advertised as 90 mins, and even the  Fast Pass  system had a queue of 30 mins, Unbelievable! (as you can see from the photo) The ride entrance is 50 yards in front on the left, it looked like Wembley stadium after the cup final.Food and drink is over the top for prices! god help a family of 4 5 if they have come in with no food or drink. they will easily get through   150   200 for drinks, ice creams, snacks, food. I saw a burger chips and a drink for 25 euros roughly   22 (see photo).Car parking is 20 euros a day, for a 3 day pass for me and my little girl that adds 60 euros on to the bill roughly   55.Selfie sticks are meant to be banned in the park Disney don't allow them. But nobody takes any notice. If someone had poked me in the ear one more time with one they would have been wearing it.Another thing that bugs me is they used to allow the Disney characters to roam round the park, and everyone could get their photos done with them. Now they have them in all different sections of the park in roped of area's where you have to queue for hours to get a snap, and your expected to buy the Disney photos as the staff deliberately stand in front of you if you try and sneak one of your own photos.That's the bad points.The good points are that the park as always is absolutely immaculate, and is a joy to see, the flower arrangements are all done this year in purple and silver representing their 25th anniversary. There is a new end show with absolutely everything on display, with lasers, fountains, smoke, fireworks, lights. And is worth the entrance fee alone. As Disney now have the Star Wars franchise, Space Mountain has been changed into a Star Wars ride, and there is a Star wars simulator ride there that's new, and is worth the wait.All in all, the bottom line is that  Its Disney  nobody does parks like them, and its probably one of the best, cleanest, well run, crowded, expensive park you will ever visit. You just have to do it!","Disneyland_Paris"

We took a weekday, the 4th of september due to the fact that school in France began on the 3rd of september. This means that less domestic visitors could be expected.

Also the stunt cars show which the 3 boys loved, the day springtime parade with all the characters were fab. Would definitely recommend booking Buffalo bills Wild West show, we all really enjoyed this, I got tickets off of Ticketnet.fr as they were cheaper and you can print them off yourself. You had food included which we were pleasantly surprised with & adults got free flowing beer & there is lots of crowd participation  yeeha . Obviously eating out in the park is quite expensive but McDonald's seemed pretty reasonable, although most places just seem to do burgers. The downside was the queues for rides, myself & sister in law queued with 3 boys for 1 hour to get on pirates of the Caribbean and when we were nearly at the front it broke down so we had to leave, we also queued for 1hr 15mins for Peter Pan ride which lasted about 2minutes. We didn't manage to get on Crush's ride as queue said 90 mins. Some rides also broke down which was slightly annoying, we used the fast pass as much as possible but these are mainly for the bigger rides. We were disappointed with the tram tour wasn't much of it really apart from 2 dramatic areas but I was expecting abit more. The best rides were Big thunder mountain, pirates of the Caribbean, Small world, space mountain, rock & roller coaster, buzz lightyear, auto mania, toy soldiers parachute drop, Even though we queued a lot we did manage to do most rides in the 3 days & some we did twice.All in all it was a great experience and glad we went although very exhausting with all the walking queuing & long days (10am 10pm) so if you have smaller ones take a buggy.

121695973,4,"2011-12","Germany","This is the second time I've been to Disneyland in HK. The last time I was there was in 2006 and it has really improved since then. There are more rides and things to do after its been extended. It doesn't have as much adrenaline junkie rides as Ocean Park has, but it does have one that I refer to as the adult ride. For me, Disneyland is more of an experience so it didn't bother me that it didn't have a lot of  adult rides . The shows were spectacular and the environment was everything I imagined Disney to be. It may not be as big as other Disney's, but it is still great and worth visiting. There is more than enough activities to keep you busy all day.It is really easy to get to Disney via MTR or even public buses. The price for MTR ride is higher, but the custom Disney detailing in the MTR station and the train makes it a great experience. The food is quite overpriced though. Popcorn is HKD25 and a bottle of water is around HKD20 as well. I didn't try any of the other food because it was around HKD60 80. The highlight for me was the firework show at the end around the infamous Disney castle. It was magical and by far one of the best firework show I have ever seen. It was the second time I've seen it, but I was still in awe! Definitely the best part I look forward to when I visit Disney. Disney tickets cost around 399HKD in comparison to 298HKD for Ocean Park, but it is worth the experience. Expect to pay around 500HKD per person for the entire day including eating and drinking. Like Ocean Park, no additional fees are required for any of the rides and shows though. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting Hong Kong, especially if you have kids.","Disneyland_HongKong"

Yes, the lines are long, but we found they typically moved faster than the signs suggested. As we are child free, I can only review adults attractions.1. Twilight Zone Tower of Terror was SO FUN! We LUUUUUHVED it and wanted to go again! Do it at night, it's way cool.2. Space Mountain is an icon.Ya gotta ride it. I don't think a roller coaster is as thrilling when you can't anticipate the next twist turn, but it's still plenty fun.3. Matterhorn might be considered politically incorrect with the stereotype, but that's why it's funny. Use the app to plan ahead, but use the gps map on your phone to navigate. WAY easier than 3 paper maps and the constant signing in required for the app. They need to fix that. It's brutal. Plus, it gave us error messages about every 3rd try.","Disneyland_California"

581036497,5,"2018-5","United Kingdom","We went back to Disneyland as Adults, having previously been as a teenager, and it is still the most magical place on earth.There were some changes to rides updates since we last went, and the Disneyland park app is fab for deciding where to go as it tells you how long the queues are and which rides are closed before you walk all over the park! We LOVED the illuminations, which are well worth waiting till close for. Get to the front of the castle and sit for about 40 mins before the show starts for the best seats. You will get a sore bum but it's worth it!We also waited in line to meet Darth Vader at Starport. Well he was fantastic. He was super intimidating and tall, and really felt like the character he was supposed to be, I bought my photo with him and it was one of the best parts of the holiday. Some of the queues were ridiculously long at certain times of the day, so use the fast passes. And if your an adult, wait until after 9.30 pm in summer to go on the Big Thunder Mountain, you can ride in the dark with other adults, it's a longer route and the staff are in good form and will make everyone clap and cheer during the loading unloading which adds a good atmosphere.Indian Jones is also worth visiting at night as the tents and cars along the waiting route have their lights on and there are flaming torch beacons lit near the end of the queue.The parades were also fab, we were there when it was Pirates Vs Princesses and watched this several times as well as the main parade. Both were fantastic. The one criticism I have of the park is the lack of snacks that aren't deep fried chicken chips! All the restaurants serve the same food, which I understand is good for mass crowds, but you cannot get fruit or veg anywhere and all the snack stalls are crisps, ice cream or cakes biscuits. I did notice a few fruit carts but these were not open when I was in the park. Also no where seemed to serve coffee or any hot drink? Maybe I was looking in the wrong places. It might be handy to have a guide with stalls and what they serve on the park map?","Disneyland_Paris"

376327791,4,"2016-5","United States","Really enjoyed! The only reason I'm not giving five stars is BC two things need to change. The first being when we arrived at the opening of the park at 10 am and made it through to the bathrooms to go see Minnie Mouse she was no longer seeing kids. She was only available for an hour. I thought that was really really really dumb. That should be an all day thing. Second, it was the same thing with Pluto and goofy. Once again really really stupid. We didn't make it to see either one. We did see the parade with Minnie and daisy but that irks me. Then have time later in the day when they are out. But really have the characters all together all day at one location. Make it easy on parents who kids love Mickey Mouse club house. Second the park needs more allergy friendly food. I would love to see them like Walt Disney world. They are all very nice and helpful but there are few options as some who is celiac with kids who are celiac that makes my life hard. They do try to accomdate but I could see the frustration on their faces as well as mine. Overall loved Disneyland. We got to ride soo many rides, meet characters, watch them walk through the crowds which was a thrill for my girls. The castle is my favorite castle. We loved being able to walk through it and see the stain glass windows. The dragon at the bottom was fantastic too. we spent most of the time in fantasyland and really enjoyed it. I would come back.

And on another day get there early so you can leave early and still do some other things. Although keeping in mind that this park is not huge and can be done in 1 day. It just depends if you have small kids with you that might get restless like we did. Food is expensive but you don't have much of a choice but to buy there.

This time we decided to stay in a Disney hotel Sante Fe   which is an okay hotel but all we did was sleep there. We took the Eurostar which is fine and paid extra   32 so that hotel checkin was completed at the station and then when we left our luggage was taken back to the station to be collected before departure   well worth it. The package included hotel, Eurostar and standard half board. I would definitely recommend half board as it meant we paid for food upfront and also included a tea time treat between 3 6pm. This saved us loads of money and in fact we just spent   100 on top. We tried the buffet at the plaza garden on Main Street, a tex mex in Disney village, restaurant des stars in Walt Disney studio and agrabah cafe in adventure land. All great! Overall it's still magical however I missed the fact that the night time parade has gone, which we didn't know until we asked other people. There is now only one parade at 5.30pm. The firework display makes up for it but it was really late so my 3 year old fell asleep. A lot of the park was closed (discoveryland and frontierland) but for us it didn't make much difference as we spent much of our time in Fantasyland. The evenings are better here as it's less packed we managed to complete everything in Disney park in 1.5days. Previously the stars were in lots of different places but this has now changed and you really need to be in places I specific times. The princesses is the worst, they've designed a pavilion however it took 1 hour and there was only one princess, why not have them all in different rooms and you just go through them all. We managed to see Snow White and Ariel after waiting 60 minutes each time. We did have lunch at the mickey' cafe which was good to see the stars but food was poor for the price   recommend breakfast which was much better. My 3 year old is really into Elsa Anna so we saw the sing a long show twice and the grand parade at least once a day. You can get photo's or signatures for them. In terms of characters some of these don't have professional photographers so you need to decide on whether photo pass  is worth it. Many individuals had paid for fastpasses before they arrived, which meant they managed to get into rides, attractions and character meet and greats without queuing but having 5 days meant we didn't need this.

Since these were mainly for taller children than ours ( 1.40m), this was not much of a problem in our case. Under other circumstance this would really have been a turn off. As others have already stated, food ist expensive and pretty mediocre in the resorts' restaurants. You're better off bringing your own picnic.On the bright side Disneyland is still  the real thing . No Mickey Mouse rip off like in other parks throughout Europe, but all your children's favourite Disney stars to pose and play with. We went for two days during the week and before the holiday season. This and good use of FastPass tickets gave us plenty of rides and enough time to do everything our kids wanted to do.For young children a very nice place to go.

Weekends are busy no matter what time of year so avoid these. Bring dome snacks keep kids occupied in queues. If going in winter months, prep for all weather. We had a rainy day this year and it was great   most queues 5 10 minutes. See the parade and Dreams at park closing. No 1 tip is to check the forum here before you go.

546098363,4,"2017-12","United States","If you like California Disneyland you   ll love Hong Kong Disneyland with its similar compact size. The park is laid out in the same pattern as its California counterpart   pass through Sleeping Beauty   s castle to enter Fantasyland, turn right for Tomorrowland, etc. Of course, there are key differences that make this park special, including hearing instructions in Cantonese before English, watching mainly Chinese cast members perform, and dining at restaurants featuring a variety of Chinese and Japanese items along with American hamburgers. It is at once a fun and cultural experience.My two favorite rides were The Iron Man Experience, a motion simulator movie ride that has Iron Man saving downtown Hong Kong Island, and Mystic Manor, a high tech reimagining of The Haunted Mansion. But no ghosts appear in this through the dark ride. Instead it retells the weird stories of explorer Lord Henry Mystic and his too curious pet monkey Albert. There are surprises funny and scary at every turn.The stage performances are top quality, including    Festival of the Lion King    with special effects, choreography, and singing on par with    The Lion King    on Broadway. My only letdown was the Iron Man Showcase when the hostess began by announcing    Our presentation will be Cantonese    and began to explain the various projects without one word of English. I was completely lost. Fortunately when Iron Man spoke, his words were only English. (Did this confuse the largely Chinese crowd?) A day   s visit here is worth the time, and you probably can do everything in one day if you come when the park opens and play all day, enjoying lunch and dinner on site.","Disneyland_HongKong"
161836910,5,"2013-5","United States","As much as I love the Magic Kingdom in Florida, Disneyland Park's compact size, coupled with so many original attractions make this park my favorite in the Disney family. The skyline of Sleeping Beauty castle and the mountains are so incredibly charming. And the dark rides are just as magical for a pair of thirty somethings as they are for children. We visited the week before Memorial Day and found the park moderately crowded. If you are a guest at the three Disney hotels, the extra magic hour in the morning will be the best time to get the rides done. The food options, both sit down and quick service were also a cut above its Florida cousin. Dining in New Orleans Square is an attraction in itself. Plan on two full days or more to do everything.Our first night we did the Fantasmic reserved seating package. This package was costly at $60 per person but the seats were quite good. Unfortunately, it is required to check in around 8 PM to reserve a good seat (a line had built up considerably before 8). We got great seats with there only being two of us, but some familes were separated. This show package and the one for World of Color at DCA are both something that Disney seriously needs to reevaluate. Customers paying a premium for reserved seating do so to avoid long lines and extended waits. Fantasmic was a great show but the hassle and cost just to have a decent view is not really worth it, in my opinion.","Disneyland_California"

We had a reduced rate so the trip was good value would have cost twice as much if i had booked it myself, a rip off. I had been there before & it seemed to me little had changed in 10 years, perhaps that's why visitors are down. Positives: kids had a great time & loved the rides, the new Ratatouille ride is fantastic & Tower of Terror was a hit. Also, kIds loved the coasters Space Mountain, Crush & Aerosmith. Stitch live was a unexpectedly good laugh to. Hotel was good, rooms clean & beds comfy, but no tea or coffee facilities in room ;0(, continental style breakfast was included. Park was very quiet & so we went on all the rides without any delays & only used the fastrack service once for ratatouille ride. Also, the dream show on the castle should not be missed very spectacular. Negatives: food is extortionately expensive & mostly crap, went to rainforest restaurant & was really disappointed, it had definitely gone downhill since the last time i was there. A friend said they had gone to the Lord sandwich bar & enjoyed it, but the kids were happy with McDonalds (as usual). I just grabbed some stuff from the breakfast bar on the second day & took it in the park with me as did a lot of other people to save some cash. Beer also extortionate so didn't bother even having a pint. I would go there again for the kids, but i would take a cooler bag full of food & drink for them, unless you have won the lottery.","Disneyland_Paris"

There is an abundance of rides to choose from and everything is so colourful and clean. We went on a Tuesday and the children (and adults) no trouble at all getting onto all of the rides they wanted to. I think the children even went on some rides twice.

Take cases to the room allocated. No Lifts so drag them up the stairs... Room although I realise it was a cheaper option we chose.. Basic it was.. Half board we went for and hotel buffet was not the best.. In fact cold and that was first evening.. Breakfast..Un organised.. No milk for child's cereals, fruit juice for children run out.. It was like going back to school dinners. Says pony rides for children, that was ponies going round a small circle at the rear of building.. Got a better ride at donkeys on local beach in England.. Pleased I didn't have large family as cost of a round of drinks is extortionate...Onto the park... If you want a shopping trip it's great... Never seen so many same old shops in one place.. Over priced... The worst bit.. All the young children dressed up as princesses and no princesses in sight.. Queue for an hour or more to have picture taken with princess, that's if they not on a break or come to the end of picture time before reaching the front.. Queue for a visit to the princess palace on the day for over an hour, get a ticket and get a time to return later that same day (if lucky) return at late afternoon to queue yet again.. And then... Wait for it... Two princesses on show ( not told which ones) and pot luck on which you get... What a let down... Hours in queue for a single princess..... Nothing for Frozen fans and bearing in mind most of the younger children were dressed as one or other.... SHAME ON THE PARK! No characters walking round just Queues Queues Queues... Understand queuing at all attractions elsewhere but these are children wanting to see princesses. you can see that the owners do not want you to sit and enjoy the sites, just want your money... If you want any tips these are mine.Walk to the park it's easier to get in. No QueueingSensible footwear is a MUST whatever it looks likeFill water bottles up from hotel EU water and take concentrated juice to add flavourTake children's snacks from home (so much cheaper)If you book for afternoon snack only expect a drink, do nut or a lolly (only four choices of lollies)Book you meals a day in advancePark is quieter in the evening and make the most of the two hours you get as hotel guest from 8am   10amIf you want a meal with princesses you need to book online two months prior to start date or you have no chance. Not sure if you can do that with breakfast with Micky but worth checking.TAKE PLENTY OF EURO'S ( you will need it)If you return to the hotel we stayed at early there are no play parks to keep your children occupied.Can play at the rear of pub but it is hard ground and a young lad fell and had to have a medic called for. Youths play football in the walkways outside of rooms so ask for a rear room especially if you have younger children who go to bed early.Fireworks so late for a four year old we never got to see them.On a plus granddaughter enjoyed it... But then she is only four...Would I go again? NOAlthough park is lovely and clean, except for some of the toilets...

Tips : do go early and start checking your ticket to the fast pass machines (applicable for the most popular games   advice the map) that will allow you to go later through the fast pass line witout or with less waiting time. Unfortunatelly, if you go for the first time it takes some time to understand the system information on line is poor and our cashier could not explain it very crearly. If you have children aged 6 7 and more do not miss the BIG THUNDER MOUNTAIN : nice, fast, exciting, long coaster that you will feel great. INDIANA JONES is very fast (no time to think what's happening) and quite short, still worth to try it.

The park was overall dirty, the toilets were smelly and not kept well at all. My girlfriend said the ladies toilet was disgustingly dirty. The cast members were not in their role. They were often seen just standing around and chatting amongst themselves and did not really care much to appreciate and be nice to the guest. I would rather spend my money at some other park or somewhere else in Paris. Dont get me wrong, a few of the cast members were really nice but the majority failed us.

The attention to detail across the park is fascinating and it's hard to take in everything as you walk around. Queues for some of the bigger rides can easily get into the hour mark but can be largely avoided with smart use of FastPass   travelling with a 5 yr old meant we were limited to many of the smaller rides and wait times were not too bad (20 30mins).Food and drink in the park is expensive and three hotdogs and drinks in one of the restaurants will set you back just north or    30.The parade is well worth a watch and recommend making your way towards the route at least 30 mins before it starts to get a good view. I wasn't expecting much if I'm honest but the scale and spectacle blew me away.We booked ahead and paid for the 1 day   2 parks but didn't even make it into the Studios.

229380365,5,"2014-9","India","I had gone with my 2.5 year old with slight apprehensions that he is too young for it! It was almost built for him! Its best to visit for a toddler, most of the rides are geared for a 3 to 4 year old I would say. We visited on a weekday and not July August as suggested by many on tripadvisor and were safe. No very long lines not so crowded.I followed a previous review ( http:  www.tripadvisor.in ShowUserReviews g294217 d543602 r140454772 Hong Kong Disneyland Hong Kong.html ) and had made a list of the many rides for him and the lands to visit first etc.I suggest you plan if you are with a toddler. The above review is pretty accurate and it helped me plan my visit immensely. We started with Tommorowland as we only reached Disney by 2 pm , and wanted to be nearby for the parade. I registered for fast pass, did obitron and autopia. He fell asleep ( just landed from a long haul flight ) so skiped Buzz Lightyear and waited for parade.UFO was shut down.After the parade we moved to fantasy land. We ate lunch at festival of foods ( average) .We registered for fast pass at Winnie the pooh. We did Dumbo, Carousel and teacups. We did character visits in the evening as the lines were lesser ( tip : first go to mickey , most of the people were stuck on minnie or pooh).We went back for our fast pass at Winnie. We saw the golden Mickey show at 5:45 pm and then waited to see the fire works at 7:30 pm. We left 10 mins before fireworks ended to avoid lines at taxi stand.We spread our visit over two days and did one show each day , so check show timings and which land you will be in to plan it accordingly.Second day , we went first to adventureland. We did the jungle river cruise ( I preped my toddler about a volcano eruption to avoid a scare) and the raft to Tarzan Treehouse ( beware :lots of carrying your toddler over stairs). After that we went to see the Lion King show ( spectacular!) . They din't have fast pass that day for it I checked before getting on the cruise.We wanted to use the shortcut way to Toy Storyland , but for some reason it was shut and not mentioned anywhere!!! So we had to go around the two new lands and only then got to Toystory land. Toystoryland is a visual marvel ( please take many photos).We went on slinky dog and I was going to skip the parachute drop. But my toddler was very excited to go on it.So I took him and although he seemed a bit uncomfortable initially , he enjoyed it too much only to go on a second time !We then moved to fantasyland , ate lunch at royal banquet hall (indoors and excellent kiddy mickey meal!) and went to 'its a small world ' ( indoors to beat the heat!) . We repeated some rides my child wanted to do again like teacups and carousel.I suggest take toddlers to fantasy land again as this is the best land for this age. We couldn't meet the characters again as lines were long in the afternoon.We saw the parade yet again and shopped on main street only to leave disney with great memories!Only thing I will change next time is visit after November when temperatures are cooler , the heat did get to us!","Disneyland_HongKong"

I figured that this could be my last time going when I arrived, but now, I want to go again. The price of the park is VERY expensive, but for me, it was worth it. The only thing that ruined my day was that the crowd control at night when we were trying to leave was out of control. I would suggest that they put uniformed security in charge and not kids trying to control the crowd. I actually saw older people in the crowd rushing through and shoving kids in wheel chairs off to the side.

We went on about 10 rides from 8:00 to 12:00, then headed over to Disney Adventureland for the rest of the day. Wait times for both parks were much worse in the afternoon. We didn't need to utilize fast passes for anything in Disneyland, and didn't wait for more than 30 mintues for anything. However, wait times were much longer in the afternoon according to the APP, and we skipped some of the rides younger kids might desire, such as Peter Pan.Certainly not a cheap day, single day park hopper passes were about $150 each. Bottom line was we had a good time, and went on every ride and saw everything we wanted to see.","Disneyland_California"

On my question, how much time I have to wait  he answered approx. 1.5 hours. That is too much for 2 years old child! That was our first impression from Disneyland Park. And it was also the strongest one! We refused to wait, went down, sit in some sheriff car, which brought us to the castle. It was a great desicion because all attractions for very small children are located in the farrest from the entrance part of the park, behind the castle.

Since I was 5 years old I have made 9 returning vacation trips to Disneyland because you are guaranteed to never be disappointed! Over the years there have been countless changes yet it remains the same. Every visit to the park I see something new and learn something new about Disneyland. Last summer I had the honor of doing the  Walk in Walt's Disneyland Footsteps' tour. This is a must do for the avid Disneyland fan. You get to actually step foot inside Walt's apartment above the fire station!! I cried like a baby when I was in there. You could just feel the aura of 1955 and how Walt must of felt sitting there looking out the window at all the guests. To me, Disneyland is so special because after 58 years it still makes you feel like a giddy kid and honestly there is no place in the world that gives me the internal happiness that Disneyland does.

216073658,5,"2014-7","United Kingdom","On my girlfriend's request, we (adults in mid twenties) booked 5 days (4 nights) at Disneyland Resort Paris. Everyone questioned why we needed so long but I am so glad we did   this timeframe gave us the opportunity to enjoy the park at a leisurely pace; rather than having to plan how to hit up all the rides in a day. However, for the duration of our visit it was raining constantly and around 18'c   in July! So the weather was not good. This was coupled with having my phone stolen and a number of issues with ride interuptions that should have ruined the experience   but the magic of Disney prevailed and we both had a great time, with fond memories and a desire to return... So, a bulletpoint review:The Good:  A good range of rides for all ages  Queue times were not terrible   only one was it over an hour   generally 30 50min for the bigger rides  The production value was AMAZING. This is what, for me, set this theme park above all others   the set design was genuinely believable and my surprise ride was the Studio Tram Tour which had me truly believing I was in a flooding canyon!  Staff were very friendly and helpful   Food was quite fairly priced   a we had meal vouchers from our hotel deal which meant free dinner and a free tea time snack (hot drink and muffin)  The Disney Dreams show was truly spectacular   and this was after being a) a huge sceptic b) being forced to wait in the cold and rain for 2 hours to ensure a good spot before the show started  The Parade was also surprisingly enjoyable though I couldn't help but feel for the poor employees forced to dance and smile with such enthusiasm  The park in general was a very clean environmentThe Bad:  On day 1 we visited four of the larger rides one after another and they were all closed due to technical difficulties and throughout our visit there were a surprisingly number of rides affected by temporary closure  Queues for any of the eateries were exhaustive   almost as long as for the rides!","Disneyland_Paris"

It's a small park with only two hotels, but it is immaculately maintained and well run. Landscaping is beautiful and there are a few rides unique to this Disney. These are Mystic Manor (the best of their haunted house genre) and Grizzly Gulch. The latter is a thunder mountain like ride with a backwards component. HongKong Disneyland will not offer a lot to thrill seekers with only two roller coasters, but is an excellent choice for a family with young kids. If is also so convenient to the airport and ground transportation is easy by taxi for about $15 US or the train. Overall a very nice, compact park.

The food in the park is reasonable (it used to be outrageously expensive INSIDE the park), and if you go mid week, the crowds are not bad at all (excluding the summertime, of course.) Many of the older rides have been upgraded or replaced by newer attractions over the years, as Disney tries to keep up with the times and changes in technology.The 9:30 pm fireworks show each night is amazing, and the Disney corporation sure knows how to put on a good show.Highly recommended for everyone of all ages!","Disneyland_California"

The Fireworks and Light and Colour Show are awesome, as is the parade, although thats better at the 5.30pm session as its night and more lights and flash at this time. It was really cool to be there at Xmas New Year time as everything is Xmas themed, and has a whole new feel to it.

Even the anticipation of getting there, and the wait to park, all give me time for my inner child to appreciate we're really there. The creativity and attention to detail that is put into every inch of the park, is unmatched in larger parks elsewhere. I especially appreciate the helpful cast members (staff) who will give you an extra map, or help when you spill your drink. Note that parking is far, far from the gate, though you may decide to walk instead of take the offered shuttle. It's worth it to see something you might miss otherwise. We spend extra time looking through the hotels and buying stuff there, too. I would give it a rating of 5 if it was less expensive, but it's become an occasional visit, instead of a monthly excursion. I still love it. I just can't keep up.","Disneyland_California"

I recommend going there during Easter as Chinese nationals have no Easter holidays and thus it should not be as crowded. Visiting on weekdays will definitely help. Food there is average. It doesn't taste spectacular but is more than acceptable. Food is a bit more expensive but alright for a theme park and cheaper than other theme parks in the world. There can be pretty long lines for games and toilets; thus visit on weekdays or go in early. The staff is helpful but then again when the theme park is stuffed there is little they can do.

475717668,4,"2017-2","United States","Went during the week following Presidents day weekend. Both parks were super crowded, with some attractions under refurbishment (i.e. Pirates, Matterhorn, etc...). I have been to Disneyworld 9 times before, but this was our first trip to Disneyland. Went primarily to have a great time :) and to experience the original park. Overall, liked Disneyland but the park was not built to accommodate modern crowds. Lines for attractions weren't necessarily that long, but since all the areas were quite small, the park always felt extremely crowded. I can appreciate the nostalgia with the park and enjoyed the original rides (i.e. Mr. Toad, Snow White and Pinocchio..) not currently offered at Magic Kingdom in Florida. However, the Disneyland castle was very unimpressive in size compared to Florida's. I liked the theme ing of the different lands, but all seems really small (besides New Orleans) and didn't take long to walk through. We all thought Big Thunder Mountain and Soarin were better at Disneyland (hand's down)! Otherwise, you could make an argument which is better for similar rides between  Land  and  World  (with the exception of Small World   interior seriously in need of basic updating at Disneyland). The Radiator Springs Racer ride was really good at DCA. Don't miss!I asked a few locals when the best off season time to go, but everyone said  there isn't one . Other noticeable things compared to Disney World, we're a lack of children in Princess costumes and very short meet and greets. My kids are past that age, but seemed liked almost every time we saw a character in the park, a cast member said they were leaving and would be back later. Fireworks were also only being done on the weekends during the time we were there.Disneyland also uses the  old  fast pass system, which I think I would have liked better, if the park wouldn't have been under construction. The path to Frontierland from Fantasyland was closed, so to get to that side of the park you to basically exit out the castle and  start over . February weather was colder than normal and should packed a few warmer clothes. Also disppointed that Pirates was under reburbishment, but knew that prior to leaving for our trip.Overall you can't compare a  land  to a  world , without bringing up  nostalgia  and  the park the Walt actually built . Anaheim lacks the space and infrastructure, while Disney World Resort is like a small city.Would I go back to Disneyland? Absolutely! However, I know where my  loyalty  stands :). Glad I went and had a good time. Not at all trying to complain the park, just making comparisons from what I've grown accustomed to at Disney World. Go and enjoy yourself! ","Disneyland_California"

The only words of caution, of course, concern price and lines. Food is expensive, as are souvenirs.

The lines at rides are never going to be negligible. That's just the way it is. My wife and I visited on a couple days that are supposedly among the least busy of the year, in late September, and the park was still packed with strollers, children mid meltdown, and packs of families stopping in the middle of a thoroughfare. A blog calls the days we went  ghost town  days.

Limited rides have fast passes but make sure you get them if you can as it does save a lot of time. Each fast pass can be taken about an hour apart (sometimes more) so make sure you plan out carefully which ride you want to go first.

We maximized the number of adult rides when we used the Max Pass to book fast passes in the other park when we were entering a ride. This gave us time to go on one ride, book another and walk onto a ride without a pass and then walk over to the other park. We checked the line up times online on the APP to ensure we did not waste time lining up. We used our steps to walk between parks instead. By day 4 we were going on our favourite rides for a second and third time. We also found the restrooms were bigger, nicer and newer in CAP. The fireworks were amazing and worth staying for. They start at 9:30 pm sharp and last 10 minutes. Secure a spot with a view of the castle. We feel the front of the line pass at Universal is superior to the Max Fast Pass at Disney but the superior one is at least 10 times more expensive. We found Wednesday to be the best day to get on rides with short or non existent line ups. The Indiana Jones ride fast pass line is not that great compared to other rides.

Disney is always so fun and always busy, but it seemed to be at a whole other level of busy on this visit. Many big rides were down off and on (Big Thunder, Haunted), and with Splash in a scheduled maintenance there were even MORE people trying to get on to what WAS open. We rarely fast pass, but resorted to it just to get on a couple rides. Loved the new Star Wars introductions and the kids loved meeting Chewbaka. Will we come back? Yes.","Disneyland_California"

152369952,1,"2013-2","Canada","We were VERY disappointed with our trip to Disneyland this time: the new multi day ticket picture taking process that was just launched this winter is leading to unbelievable lines just to get in, tired and rude staff and patrons and a significant reduction of our time in the park (20 40 mins a day   more when we park hopped   lost to lines just to get into the parks). While we appreciate the need to stop people from selling sharing their multi day tickets, the staff at the gates need to find a better, more friendly way to manage the lines and to get people through the process and into the park. We lost a lot of time each day to the confusion and poor people management at the gates. For example, on Saturday, two monorail trains left in the morning empty as the staff at the Downtown Disney Monorail gates were unable to process tickets, take photos and answer the multitude of questions raised. The line just stopped moving. I have never experienced anything like it at a Disney Park and we go multiple times each year.We hope that they fix this quickly.","Disneyland_California"
12481035,4,"missing","Canada","Getting there     Arriving at Terminal 2, at CDG, proceed all the way to the other side of the terminal to the rail station     you have to go downstairs after you see the large metal arches out the window. You can catch the TGV or the RER (A4) to the parks, but the TGV has room for luggage. This part isn   t too bad, you can also book a VEA shuttle online and you will be at the parks in about 40 minutes vs the 10 on the train. It takes all of about 20 minutes to get out of the arrivals area     depending on how fast your luggage gets out     as the customs seems to be as much a formality as anything else. If you find it cheaper, you can land in London and then transfer to the St. Pancras Rail station and then take the Eurostar in and make use of the Disney Express service. This should work like it does in WDW. If you took the train, be aware that you have to go through the Disney Village to get to the hotels area and the hotels all back onto the lake. You will as often as not have to hunt for the front desk. If you are staying at the Sequoia as I did, you have to go to the second floor for check in. The Hotel New York and Newport Bay both have ground level or at least more obvious front desk areas. If you are staying at the Disneyland Hotel, arriving by rail, you want to go the rightmost building before you enter the parks to get to their front desk. Hotel service and staff     decent, most staff will try to help if you don   t speak French and they don   t speak what you speak, but some don   t and these people will often seem crabby. The ones that speak more than one language are very helpful. Be prepared to get a mountain of paper for tickets, charge cards and meal coupons. Hotel rooms     I stayed at the Sequoia Lodge and found the room nice, a bit run down with random damage and some odd    artifacts    here and there (not unsanitary, but makes you wonder why it wasn   t cleaned however long ago). The room was spacious and being on a corner we were able to open windows to get a nice cross breeze for when the heat in the room was too high. We were on a non smoking floor, but as there were smoking floors in the hotel, you could smell smoke now and again and some rooms had people smoking     either as guests or when they visited from another floor hotel whatever. Characters     great, these people are great, play with and playing up the crowds regardless of size. I was especially floored by a Goofy who kept checking up on me during a dinner to make sure I was sitting up properly and the Robinson boys playing hide and go seek with me while I was trying t take their picture. One note     the characters won   t always stop to sign for the kids. This is a bit of a bummer, but often they are there to be part of the parks and if they are running, follow them and they might stop and sign when they get to a place where they can stop for a bit. Other times they don   t have the right gloves to hold a pen. There are however a great number of canned meet and greet locations.Dining   Great good was to be had just about everywhere. My wife and I enjoyed the breakfast in the hotel (Sequoia Lodge) more than the one breakfast that we took in the park. Special mention to Agrahba Cafe, Innoventions and Auberege de Cinderellion. Suggestions (Steve Jobs, are you listening    ? Apparently the Great Steve was there at the same time and being the majority owner of Disney, he can make changes just as he already has with the dropping of D2D sequels)     BAN SMOKING IN THE PARKS. Not only are the smokers rude with their smoking     though being from North America where smoking is increasingly taboo, I realize that the social taboos are not all shared, but I can   t imagine anyone enjoying second hand smoke being blown at them or their children. Smokers not only litter the parks with their buts, but this also leads to more garbage and a general lack of respect for the parks. If there were more garbages that might also help, they seemed to be conspicuously absent in this park as it seems that you can't turn around in the American parks without seeing one   or having one walk by.Overall (from a North American viewpoint): If you have been to the American parks and have the chance to come here, certainly make the trip to see what is different and enjoy the place (don't mind the people). If you are a Disney nut, then be sure to come here. If you have only one opportunity to ever see a Disney park and you can't make it to Orlando, this is still a great place to visit.","Disneyland_Paris"

Our boys are aged 14 and 9 and I would say this is aimed at a slightly younger age bracket however we spent 14 hours there and all really enjoyed the day. I recommend arriving when the park opens at 8am to beat the worst of the crowds as the middle of the day was very busy and queues at their longest (over an hour). Their FastPass system works well so you can guarantee getting on some rides without a queue (you don't have to pay more for this but they limit the release of the tickets so plan your day carefully). The Fantastia show & fireworks in the evening were amazing and worth staying until 9.30pm to see. We took a picnic and bought one meal there to reduce the cost (e.g fish & chips $9.99 so not too bad). There are water fountains for drinking by all restrooms. We liked the original Disney park (we didn't do the Adventure Park) because of the nostalgia, the parade, the lighting show etc. There seemed to be a similar mix of types of rides in each park, no big rollercoasters but enough thrill rides for our one day visit. It's expensive but we felt it was worth it as an experience and a 'one off' (Universal Studios is much better!).","Disneyland_California"

To add to the crowds, Disney has turned Space Mountain into Hyperspace Mountain (yes, it was awesome), added a preview film for the next installment of Star Wars, and revamped Star Tours to include a part from the new movie. They might as well rename Tomorrowland to Star Wars land, luckily we're fans.

257571608,4,"2014-12","United States","It's probably worth noting that I'm a big Disney fan and I'm also a pretty big fan of France. I was an exchange student in high school and again in college, so not only am I comfortable with the food, but also the language, culture, customs, etc. So, after all these years I finally bit the bullet and went to Disneyland Paris...The truth is, when I travel abroad, usually the last thing I want to do is anything I can do at home. This means avoiding McDonalds (except when I need a bathroom    around the world, this is the Golden Arches' most awesome planetary contribution    clean and available toilets!), skipping most shopping malls, limiting tourist trap time, etc. But after all the stories, I finally wanted to see the European version of Disneyland for myself. Hopefully what follows is a pretty fair analysis...First, it's NOT Disneyland    la Anaheim, California. If that's what you're looking for, come and visit the Golden State. Similarly, EuroDisney is NOT DisneyWorld. If four parks in one is your speed, go and visit the Sunshine State.At the same time, Disneyland Paris is also not entirely France either, but bear with me on this one    I'll explain...SHORT ANSWER:If you want kickass rides that're cooler and faster and more twisty turny than what you can find in Disneyland and DisneyWorld, GO TO EuroDisney! The truth is, the French versions of Space Mountain, Rock and Roll Roller Coaster, Indiana Jones ride, and Thunder Mountain Railroad are all far more fun than their American counterparts. And, on the whole, the rides last even longer with shorter wait lines. Plus, you've also got Tower of Terror, Pirates of the Caribbean (with a better, more logical, less Johnny Depp version), Haunted Mansion, Star Tours, etc which are more of the less the same. AND you get some pretty cool attractions like Alice's Labyrinth (it's a hedge maze    perfect for when the kids have six times the energy you do), Ratatouille (awesome ride for ages six to 14    more on this later), the Toy Story rides and area, etc.BUTIf you want that amazing Disney  magic,  then I hate to say it, but other than Ratatouille, the European version of the park largely misses the mark, or at least shows that it's an imitation rather than a unique presentation...You see, in either of the US Disney parks, the backstage areas are truly backstage    the suspension of disbelief is pretty strong because you can't look from, say, Sleeping Beauty's castle in to the backstage area of a couple other attractions. In France, the wires are largely  visible.  The Small World might have insipid music to rot your brain and it might have aged poorly with feeble replacements, but you can see that it ORIGINALLY was top of the line, while the version in Paris is a cheap knockoff with the same, tired stereotypes but lacking the art. Ditto for the Peter Pan ride and Pinocchio too. Add to this that the second park in Paris is a lame, soul less ripoff of Hollywood circa 1920's and you get the idea. Oh, and WHATEVER you do, do NOT do the  studio  tour unless you truly have less than no clue about special effects...This is NOT to say that EuroDisney isn't magical, but it has it's own kind of wonder.As I mentioned, the Ratatouille ride is a surprising blend of technical wizardry and showmanship that will delight    complete with food smells, 3D, nice staging, clever use of automation, etc. I understand the Crush ride is similar. And, like I said, the roller coasters kick butt! The stuff to do outdoors is a nice respite from perennial lines. The shows are okay, but nearly all of them require an understanding of French. And Disneyland Paris is probably a little cheaper than either US park in terms of both tickets and food. Plus, it has all the shopping opportunities you'd expect from the money hungry mouse and company...DETAILSIf you've been to France or really anywhere else in the world, you've probably noticed that customer service is NOT standard among all cultures. And, Paris is probably nearer to the bottom end of what you find in Europe. What is nice is that EuroDisney has tried REALLY hard to get as much of the attention to detail as they can in, but, if you're used to other Disney parks, you might feel it's only a B  in comparison.Getting to and from the park is actually really easy. It is served by the RER line A4 (red), stop Marne la Vallee east of Paris. You can get on at a number of stations downtown Paris and the trip is about 45 minutes. It's super easy, even if you can't speak a word of French. If you can't handle this, you should probably stay home anyway...The two parks face one another and are relatively uncrowded first thing in the morning. Both have fast passes    you can have one active at a time. And neither is tremendously large; combined they're smaller than the two parks in SoCal. If you're hard core, you can do both parks completely in one day, but if you've got little ones, you'll probably need two or more days to get to everything (or I'm totally jealous that your kids don't get cranky when tired!).Pretty much every single member of the cast speaks English quite well and most of the signs are either obvious or in both languages. Now, most of the other tourists there are either British, French, Spanish, or German, but that's another story. The one bummer you might have is any of the shows    yup, there's a nod to English, but they're in French, so if vous ne pouvez pas comprendre la fran  ais, it'd probably be better to skip the show and go on another one of the rides. Plus, again, all of the  behind the scenes  and  special effects  stuff is only going to impress someone wet behind the ears or with special needs.If you have special needs, Disneyland Paris might be a bit more challenging than the US counterparts. First, forget what I said about using the Metro    unlike London, Paris has TONS of seemingly needless stairs everywhere. If you've got wheels, it won't be fun AT ALL. Second, once you get to EuroDisney, you must have a note from your doctor, describing in detail and condition you might have in order to get one of those passes. Third, unlike the US parks, the rides in EuroDisney are not as roomy    they're more like what you'd find in Universal Studios in terms of dimensions and body shape tolerance. But, they do go faster and spin way more...Would I go again? Sure!Would I make a trip JUST for this? No way.This trip did whet my curiosity to check out one of the OTHER Disney parks in Japan, Hong Kong, or Shanghai.But, quite honestly, before I come back to EuroDisney, I think I'd rather check out Euro Park in Rust, Germany first...","Disneyland_Paris"

HK$98 for a Chicken burger, Chinese Noodles (HK$105), Rice curry (HK$118), coffee (HK$28). We brought (smuggled) some bread but I saw the Mickey Lunchbox (HK$38) (original price was HK$68) if I get the Chicken burger, so I bought the set (lunchbox was for the daughter, not for me!! OK?)Caramel Popcorn was nice at HK$40 per carton, and you get a refill at HK$28 if you show your used carton..

I visited on a Thursday as having read many reviews I wanted to avoid the weekend when more local guests visit. I also opted for a Disney Dining package to cut down on costs. Travelled to the park using MTR from Hong Kong via Sunny Bay. Ordered tickets online and picked up at  Magic  collection booths to avoid queues. First off it's small, compared to WDW in Orlando it's tiny and even compared to Paris it's small. That said everything is really accessible, you can criss cross the park easily and I would say 1 day is more than enough to take in the major attractions and shows. If you do have small ones then maybe 2 days would be needed as it can get hot and the queues tend to be for the Fantasy land rides of which only the Winnie the Pooh ride has FastPass.Whilst I was there many of the food outlets were closed so I was restricted using my food vouchers, however there were 4 5 places I could use them. The food options are varied with both Western and Oriental options. Prices vary from HK$95 for a burger combo to HK$159 for a mixed grill combo. There are side dishes available too for uner HK$50.Main Street was crowded at the 10:30am rope drop as the Main Street is smaller than other parks but guests dispersed quickly and after heading straight to Tomorrowland there were no queues for Hyperspace Mountain   I rode 3 times without having to queue.Some areas open and close at different times   Grizzly Gulch opened at 11 and closed at 19:45   I'm assuming for  crowd  management and maintenance. Throughout the day I was able to re ride a few times on the main roller coasters without queueing   longest wait was 15 minutes on Runaway Mine Cars due to a hardware glitch.Many of the rides are similar to the US and Paris versions but with subtle differences. Space Mountain is tamer than Paris but racier than Orlando   no inversionsRunaway Mine Cars   has cool reverse section like Everest in Animal KingdomMystic Manor   Haunted Mansion 2.0  serious upgrade.Ironman Experience   Star Tours rebrand.Only 3 FastPass rides Hyperspace Mountain, IronMan experience and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh   nothing over in Grizzly Gulch or Toy Story Land.Lots of rides have indoor sections so you aren't outside in the heat and humidity all day.Park was kept clean and tidy with no obvious signs of litter.All in all a great value day out.","Disneyland_HongKong"

If you plan your trip in advance, you know on which day you want to visit for sure, so you can get the tickets way cheaper online, if you decide the exact date.We went on a cloudy Monday and it was worth it! The park wasn   t crowded at all. I wanted to use FastPass at first, but there was no need using it. The longest waiting time was about 15 minutes. I think we had to wait much more at the airport for security check. (Well, that   s the place I want a FastPast, for sure! :) )The Park was clean, nice, and fun, just as always, except for one thing. I checked online the closed attractions, and I chose this Monday, because there was only a few closed    or at least that   s what I saw online, when I checked the homepage. I can   t even explain how disappointed I was, when I found out that we cannot go inside the Sleeping Beauty   s Castle (which, I think, is the main event for a girl who is princess addicted), or visit Pocahontas    Village, ride Peter Pan    Flight, see La Tani  re du Dragon, and so on    I honestly don   t know, where should I have checked this information in advance, so just one advise: be prepared that you won   t see some attractions.Food and drink is super expensive in the Park, so prepare some food (or buy it in advance), and bring it with yourself, there is no problem with bringing food inside the Park! Goodies: all for children    I know that Disney is basically for kids, but there were lots of adults enjoying the Park. Just a few jewelries for them, all the cool stuff were in kids    size.4 years ago I was in Tokyo Disneyland, and honestly, there was no enough money for all the cool stuff I wanted to buy. I hope that someday they will import at least a part of it to Paris Disneyland.We stayed till closing time, and the fireworks and illuminations at the Castle was a blast, totally worth to watch it. The train station is close to the Park, I recommend to use it.","Disneyland_Paris"

The resort is well connected by road and MTR. Since we had booked our tickets online in advance, we did not have to stand in the queue for long. This might also be because we planned to be there on weekdays, we reached earlier than park opening on both days and of course our little cheat sheet route plan. For us the BEST part about Disneyland were the parades, and shows (including the little side acts!)   My advise would be : dont miss any at all as far as possible, even if it means missing a ride or two. Two days are an overkill and might only be required for HK Disneyland if its crowded   weekend. We managed to complete all shows and all rides in 1.5 days. It turned out to be a lucky plan because the Paint the night parade was cancelled because of rain on Day1. There was an Easter egg hunt theme underway while we were there, and both kids LOVED it as well. All of us had different favorite rides...but we found something to love in each land, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Adventure Land, Toy Story Land, Mystic Point, Fantasy Land.

To be honest I rather go visit a natural park but I was quite curious to check out  the happiest place on earth . Just listen to stories of others I always thought it was magical... so to my surprise it wasn't. I was disappointed. Lots and lots of people, hundreds of pushchairs and even more children screaming and crying... Well some of the rides were fun but just getting to one seemed to be a mission... It took seldom less than 30min to get into a ride which in the end only lasted 5 10min. It is one of the most commercialized places on earth... after each ride you have to leave through a store... So dont forget to buy something... Was it worth it? I don't know... I've seen greater and more magical things and I didn't like the expensive price for still staying in line for ages...

236587119,5,"2014-10","United States","Cannot say enough good things about our time here!Everyone has a good idea what to expect from Disney, so here are a few of my extra tips.Meeting Ana and Elsa: Getting to see these girls is like winning the Disney lottery. Get to the park when it OPENS, they will hold the crowds right before the castle until opening. Then make a bee line to your right back to Fantasyland, there will be plenty of cast members directing you to the line. You need to have all your tickets for your family and everyone has to be checked into Disneyland already. One person can wait in line (took about 45 minutes) with the tickets while the others ride (this worked out well for us since many of the rides in Fantasyland had short lines at this early time). You will get a return time ticket with a 20 minute window when you can return to meet them. You will stand in yet another line do to so (took about 25 minutes). Trust me if you have a tiny human who loves Frozen it is worth it. Ana and Elsa even signed a sweatshirt for us and took many pictures, answered questions etc. If standing in lines to meet princesses isn't your thing, the good news is you can still catch these two as they have a float that precedes the parade! :)Also your Meet and Greet time does not count as a fastpass, so you can get may have both at the same time!!Radiator Springs: The cars ride is an AWESOME ride and well worth the wait. Fast Pass the ride as soon as you get to California Adventure (by 11am the fast pass return time was already 6:40pm)Magic Hours: Be sure to take advantage of these times. The park is substantially less crowded and wait times are LOW.World of Color Show: It is more than worth it. Get a fast pass for it, and you will have a much better viewing. The fast pass does not count like a typical fast pass and so you can still have a ride fast pass at the same time! FYI  it is almost a 30 minute show, so make sure little ones have a good view or you will have tired arms and shoulders. Wait times: We were at Disneyland on a Friday (10 24) and were pleasantly surprised how short most wait times were! You can fast pass your larger more popular rides as well, so squeeze in the smaller rides around these. We went to California Adventure on Saturday (10 25) and it was busier but most wait times were still under 30 minutes.Don't Miss: The Haunted Mansion is all decked out in Nightmare Before Christmas stuff and is AMAZING! If you typically on this ride it is well worth it this time of year!!Warning: We did have a surprising number of people cut us in lines. One person would stand inline and then a group of 4 or 5 people would simply walk in front of us to meet their friend. We spoke up a few times and most people let us go ahead of them. Just keep an eye out.Bring your patience and enjoy, it is Disney and it can really be the most magical place on earth! Bring your patience, ","Disneyland_California"

228364488,4,"2014-8","United Kingdom","DisneylandParis is obviously crammed full of all that Disney magic that you'd expect. It's absolutely fantastic for the kids and you can tell that the adults are really enjoying it too. If you come here, you're already bought into the whole Disney experience, so nothing should really come as a surprise to you. The park is over 20 years old now, and I think it's beginning to show. It is all just getting a little bit old fashioned I think. This visit was our third in about 4 years, and it's beginning to drag a little now. The best things to tell you about is the new Ratatouille ride. It's awesome. Do not miss it. But be prepared for the queue. It's massive. It is great though. The worst things are the usual. Massive queues for rides, massive queues for restaurants, massive queues for access to characters. Poorly managed queues with loads of pushing, shoving and queue jumping. Food in the restaurants is expensive and generally of a poor quality and usually follows American themes. Food from the fast food outlets is again expensive and certainly not fast. The park needs at least to double it's restaurant capacity. The parades are well over hyped and is it really necessary to sit on the pavement for 90 minutes before they start as nearly everyone seems to do. If your body can take it, stay for the fireworks lightshow at the end of the day. It is worth the wait. Overall, a visit to DisneylandParis is going to be a lot of queuing, expensive and tiring. You won't get on anywhere near the amount of rides attractions as you expect. But, you know all that before you get here anyway. I am going to give DisneylandParis a miss now, save up, and try my luck in Orlando instead. btw, we stayed at Davy Crockett ranch and would recommend it a lot.","Disneyland_Paris"

Despite needing to change lines it is really easy for English speaking people; simple touch screens but just be sure you have cash or coins as some machines are specific. The Disney train is so cool it has mickey shaped windows, Mickey grab holds from the roof, really, really plush seating and golden Mickey ornaments on display through the cabins Okay so it cost us $299HKG per adult to get in (about $50 AUS US) and were there for three hours but hey it's Disneyland!!!No Indiana Jones, no haunted mansion, no splash mountain, no big thunder rail way and no Matterhorn but they do have space mountain and the very cool RC ride in Toystory land the jungle cruise was as corny as usual if a little on the fast side.Plenty of kettle corn, yum, and other Disney delicacies Main street looks the same but smaller than Anaheim and maybe less spectacular than Tokyo.Would I go back to this park? Probably not but I would recommend it to those with littlies who are experiencing their first Disney park. still the happiest place on earth and still a magic kingdom but easily do able in a day with young kids in tow.

555292429,3,"2017-12","United States","First off I will make sure you the reader know, I am well aware that Disneyland Paris is smaller and therefore different than Disney World FL. Knowing this I still dreamed of seeing DL Paris. We are huge fans. First the good points. Several rides are longer and better than those at Disney World Fl. Big Thunder Mountain is my favorite! What a delight to have the track longer and more exciting. Pirates and Phantom Manor were also superior to WDW. The castle is stunning and the dragon's lair a surprising and amazing addition to what previous parks have done. The Christmas Parade was very nice, but a bit short. What I especially enjoyed was the Christmas Carols playing throughout the park. Traditional carols. So nice!!There were some disappointments that really took a lot of the magic away for us. The following items made Magic Kingdom just a kingdom: 1.) lack of cast members. We visited in Dec. It was quite busy, yet only 4 cast members were selling tickets. We stood in line nearly an hour. 2.) Inside the park, signs for handicap lines are misleading. They direct up or down ramps and then stop without further signage. No cast members outside of most rides where handicap guests queue, so several times we had to wander about to find where we needed to go. 3.) Most seating for quick serve is outside. Minimal inside. It was very cold when we visited. Iy us vold for enough months that this should not be the case. 4.) Because of this at Dinner time we stood in the line for walk ins at a buffet restaurant on Main St. The line was more of a slightly organized mob. No direction or information from cast members as to what the huge back up was. No one was being seated. It was very poor service. We were in line about an hour. At least once we were seated the food was excellent. Our waitress was much more pleasant than the cast members who worked up front in the restaurant.In all the magic of Disney is not just one thing. It's the rides and they stories behind them. The food and the cast members who cook and serve. All the cast who come in contact with guests. All this and more make the magical places Walt Dreamed of. Here, there's is some Magic, but like a sparked holding on, it fizzles primarily because of poor cast labor management.","Disneyland_Paris"

180150071,5,"2013-10","Belgium","We went several times to the park already before, but this time it was special as our kids are 3 and 5 years old which is a good age to really have a magical experience. It's great to see their excitement when they spot a Disney character walking around, or when they watch the parades. It was a shame though that 'It's a small world' was closed for renovation, we looked forward to taking the kids to that one. Instead we went many times to the 'Buzz Lightyear' attraction which was a good replacement. If you can, try to go during a weekday as it will be much less busy. We arrived on Friday and could do most of the park in 1 day. When we returned on Saturday we had to queue sometimes for more than an hour which makes it more difficult with younger kids and more tiring. I recommend to go for a few days (3 is enough) and take a hotel nearby so you can go back and take some rest during the day. We did it like that, and went back to the park in the evening then to enjoy the fireworks at 22.00 which was one of the highlights of the visit. We had a magical time.","Disneyland_Paris"
230877836,5,"2014-9","United States","You don't need to be told that a trip to Disneyland is fun... if you are reading this you are probably already planning on going. I just wanted to give those of you that are unfamiliar with the park a few ideas on how to make your day more entertaining, easier, and less expensive.Dining: Dining in the park is expensive, but in most cases the food is pretty good quality. The two places that I recommend dining for families are: The Plaza Inn on Main Street: The fried chicken meal here is solid, filling, and serves two adults nicely. At $16, this is a great bargain when split between two. If have one child with you, the meal can be split three ways with the addition of a cobb salad. Their cobb salad is fantastic and very large! ($12) Lunch at the Plaza is the best food deal in the park in my opinion. The French Market Restaurant in New Orleans Square: As the sun starts getting low, and your feet grow tired, finding someplace to sit and dine for a while is a good thing. The French Market offers just that, and in a location that is far enough away from the parade routes that you won't have to fight horrid crowds to get here. Our favorites are the beef stew or clam chowder bowls ($10). These give just enough protein to get you back on your feet, and just enough sourdough bread bowl to fill you up. Dining here is on the patio, and jazz bands regularly perform here, giving your little ones a chance to get up and dance to burn off some of that pent up energy from standing in lines.What To Do (other than rides): Disneyland has some fantastic rides, but the lines get tiring. Here are a couple thoughts on what to do between rides. Hidden Mickeys: A quick Google search for  Disneyland Hidden Mickeys  will turn up a wealth of information. Educating yourself on where to find some of these will give something for you and your kids to do as you explore the park. A hidden Mickey is the shape of Mickey's head hidden in the design of different things around the park. I'll give you one right now... when the yogurt shop in Toon Town is closed, the roll down sales counter cover has a mickey integrated into the cow pattern painted on it. Disneyland Railroad: Need a place to park the kids for half an hour or so while they catch a quick cat nap... try the Disneyland Railroad. Getting off your feet for a loop (or two or three) around the park while the little one dozes against your shoulder can be a welcome relief from the heat of the midday sun. Pin Trading: When Disneyland created Pin Trading in the parks, they created a wonderful activity for kids (and us big kids) to do while exploring the parks. You can certainly stop by just about any store in the park and pick up a  starter set  that includes a lanyard and several pins to trade. If you really want to save some money though, pre purchase on eBay a batch of pins to take with you. It really doesn't matter what is in the batch, you are just buying something for the kids to trade with. Any cast member wearing a layard or belt patch with pins will happily trade with your family, and they will trade absolutely anything of their for anything of yours. Park guests may also be wearing lanyards, and it never hurts to ask them if they wish to trade, but some of these guests are serious collectors and may refuse to trade something (rare) that they are wearing for what you have to offer. Safer to have your kids stick with the cast members unless a nice guests approaches you and offers to trade.Other suggestions: Here are just a couple other suggestions for your visit. Fantasmic: This is a great water light show to catch if you are at the park late enough to enjoy it. I will probably be criticized for sharing this little suggestion so publicly, but here it is. As people are gathering along the river side walkways to wait for the show to start, you will notice two very large metal sound light platforms that have been raised from below the walkways. People avoid standing behind these because your can't see much through all the framing cabling staff. Here's the interesting part though... when the show starts, these raise high above the level of the walkway, leaving nothing but a thick metal pole to block view. If you stake out a spot behind one of these risers, slightly off center, you should be left with a nice view of the show once the risers... well... rise.  Fireworks: Sometimes it is hard to keep the little kids awake long enough to see the fireworks, and dealing with the crowds on Main Street during and just after the fireworks is a nightmare. One trick that I learned when my son was little was to leave the park a while before the fireworks start, take the tram back to the parking structure, get up to the level we were parked on, and watch the fireworks from the relative calm of the edge of the parking structure (as you get to the top of the escalator, head right and the view off the right side of the walkway looks towards the fireworks). I don't think you get to hear the music or narration from there, but the view is pretty nice.  Lockers: There are lockers located near the front of each park (in Disneyland, half way down main street, on the right, at the back of the alley) and between the parks on the Disneyland side. These are full day use lockers that you can get in and out of as you wish. The cost is $7 $15, but it is worth it. Take your light jackets for evening, a pile of snacks to tide you over between meals, and get a good locker. As the day progresses, take snacks and jackets out, and put purchases in... and carry as little as possible. You will be much more comfortable during a long day if you can avoid playing the family pack mule.That's about it. Here's wishing you the best possible visit to the happiest place on earth!","Disneyland_California"

She did enjoy it, but even she found the queuing challenging. 2 hours plus to see the Princess Palace and average ques of 1 & 1 2 hours for most other rides was common place. The costs are extremely high for food and drink and the quality extremely poor. 14 euros for a hot dog (cold) & fries plus long waits even though the ques seemed manageable. Queueing for car park entry, queuing for bag search, queuing for entry to the park and queuing for just about everything. On our last day we only managed one attraction and lunch. The rest was   you guessed it   Queuing! Even the 5 year old complained 'but we've only done one thing!'We saw no characters walking around the park in the four days we spent there.The park was clean ish but most alarming was the fact that the car parks were not illuminated at night. Maybe 10,000   cars and families walking around in the pitch black did not feel very safe and an accident waiting to happen. There were lights installed but not switched on. Shame on you Disney!On the plus side the parade was good   but far from great. The night time illumination and fire works were great and almost worth waiting for. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was excellent fun.in Summary if you enjoy queuing and spending extortionate amounts of money of awful food then this is the place for you!

Quality rides with a good queue system   really helps with queue cutting attempts from some park visitors. Service wise, more consistent service and enthusiasm can be had from all cast members. There seems to be a lack of happiness and smiles are not that forthcoming. Not really the happiest place on earth I guess.I went with a 1 and 3 year old, and would appreciate more baby care rooms.

We visited both California Adventure and Disneyland with a two day ticket (not park hopper). The tickets were expensive but it   s Disney so to be expected. We didn   t have to queue for anything for more than twenty minutes, and took advantage of the fast pass and single rider lines in doing so. We also liked that the ticket allowed us to exit and re enter the park on the same day  we ate at Downtown Disney and returned for the evening parade. As long as you   re prepared for Disney (comfortable shoes, aware that it may be crowded, flexible about going on different rides etc.) then it   s a great day out. We didn   t arrive at rope drop and didn   t find the crowds too bad, but visited on a Thursday Friday  so weekends or school holidays may be quite different. Would reccomend visiting  there   s heaps to do if you want to spend a full day (or two) there.","Disneyland_California"

That said, the queues are too long, the food is expensive on the park and unhealthy combinations of pizza, hot dogs, burgers etc and fizzy drinks saw us sneak a healthier picnic alternative in (you're not supposed to) but by day 2 we'd had enough of what was on offer. When we visited lots of the rides etc were closed for refurbishment, given what you are paying this is unforgiveable and we did have a tearful session on more than one occassion. As we were staying at Newport Bay we could walk to the park and back to stretch out those atrophying muscles standing in 1 queue or another all day (and evening). It would also have been nice not to be staying on a building site and the fact that we paid full price with no reductions for noise dust factors was also unforgiveable.

Food was also bad and expensive. It was quite weird, that the same food (especially bad coffee and lame bakings) was offered everywhere in park though the cafees and restaurants were so different and well set up. Indeed I came to suspect, that e.g. Nestle and Buttoni (frozen pizzas) are paying to Disney corp. for serve their products as promotional purposes. I gave 3 5 despite of too long queues and bad food, because me and my family really liked the park's atmosphere and attractions.

302452901,2,"2015-8","Singapore","The frustration started with the booking process, when we simply could not get our tickets via the website. We wrote to them, and they said it was our bank which disallowed the transaction to go through. We ended up trying with credit cards from three different banks, and calling up each of the three banks, but all of them said the same thing   that it was the website that was not working. Disneyland Paris refused to accept that and continued blaming our banks.We finally got somebody staying in France to help us to purchase the three day tickets. Unfortunately for us, the frustrations did not end there.We got the feeling that they were simply trying to cram as many guests in the park as possible, to maximise revenue. They did not really care about the guest experience etc.The carpark gantry where they were collecting the car parking fees felt more like a border checkpoint, with lines stretching hundreds of metres, and waits of up to an hour   just to pay 15 euros to enter the carpark. It was more of the same at the security checkpoints (where they checked the bags of guests) and the park entrances. In the parks, queues were also very long and we spent at least 70% of our time waiting in line at the rides, eateries, shops, washrooms etc.The level of cleanliness in some areas in the park was also pretty appalling. The washrooms were almost always unclean. Tables and chairs at the eateries also commonly needed a good wipe (we saw many people doing that). There are also many corners in the park where one can definitely smell pee. Probably people had given up (or were unable to continue) waiting in line at the washrooms and just relieved themselves elsewhere.We also felt uncomfortable that people were smoking everywhere in the park, and that the only place where one could avoid having cigarette smoke blown in your face was, ironically, at the designated smoking corners. When this is supposed to be a kid friendly place, I am not sure if they might want to do something about it.We found language to be a problem in some areas in the park as well. I guess this is not totally the fault of the park operators. After all, we were in France, and it was therefore expected that there are always some people, service staff included, who only spoke French and nothing else. However, considering the international clientele of this place, it would have been a nice touch if they tried to teach their staff members to speak additional languages.","Disneyland_Paris"

The park was fairly busy, but if you plan right then you know which rides to go on and at which times. I would always recommend Fast pass, it really is a time saver, and also single rider is a must, we decided to join the single rider for the ratatouille ride which was a 5 minuite wait rather than the 60 minuite wait in the normal line. After the very short wait we managed to get on the same cart next to each other so that was amazing, beating the 1 hour line.The shops generally sell all the same merchandise so don't fret too much if there is a shop you miss out on. I loved all the rides and most specifically, big thunder mountain, buzz lightyear lazer blast, and crushs coaster, the first two offer fast pass, but crushs coaster only offers single rider, but its deffinetly worth it. The only ride I didnt like was the tram tour, it was sorry to say  Boring , it wasnt a comfortable ride, and there was a lack of interesting and relevant scenes to see, it was outdated.Food wise, its mostly burgers, but they do the job, don't expect a huge variety, there are 3 set menus a beef burger, a chicken burger and thats about it. There are other restaurants dotted around but the prices are a little out of budget, when all you want if to fill you up when your peckish.Regardless, this was my favourite holiday, and best experience. The scenery, the music and the general atmosphere of the park were amazing, I cant wait to go back.There are rides and events to suit every age, and i suggest to give everything a go, its worth the wait.

We were aware that Space Mountain was closed for the year, but many other rides attractions were closed frequently for problems. To list a few:  Indiana Jones   we obtained a fastpass and when we returned the ride was closed. The next day, once again the ride was closed and finally on our third try we managed to get on. (It was a good ride, for your information and worth the wait).  Matterhorn   we were told by other people that they spent 75 minutes in the lineup only to be turned away when they got to the entrance as the ride was shutdown for maintenance after problems. People were led off the ride. This occured on at least 2 3 occasions. We gave up and didn't bother going on it. Pirates of the Caribbean   We went on this ride after about a 30 minute wait and got stuck on it at the part where the town is all singing  Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!  for at least 30 minutes. This is not a pleasant experience and actually people were getting kind of panicky.  Haunted Mansion   We had a temporary stall when we were on this ride, but only for about 5 minutes. Still, this added to the list of malfunctions in the park.We were not pleased to find we had arrived during the California Spring Easter Break and lineups and crowds were overwhelming.Unlike most reviews, however, we really enjoyed California Adventure. If you are going, check out the restaurant by Soaring over California   the  all dressed fries  (not sure of the name, but they have fries, chili, sour cream, cheese, onions, etc and are fabulous and a good bargain!) The rides are more exciting for older children teenagers and the Aladdin show is awesome. Also, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, a Bug's life, and many others. Very worthwhile.","Disneyland_California"

The staff cared very little   gave us a voucher to skip the line for the same ride, but it was not working so what's the point? Train stops at 5PM or something like that, boat as well.

We breezed through the lines for all of the rides that this kids wanted to ride at both Disneyland and California Adventure. The crowd the Wednesday that we were there was crazy. We would have ridden very little, if not for the guide.Not only did the VIP service provide a great guide, but we were also the beneficiaries of VIP seating for the fireworks.

I recommend getting a fast pass for a ride with a long line right off the bat. Then as soon as that one is used, go get the next one, and so on all day. With a little strategy and planning, you won't have to wait too long for any ride and you can do all the good rides easily in one long day. It's also great if you stay at a Disney resort because then you get into the park an hour early. We use that time to do the non fast pass Fantasy Land rides that usually have ridiculously long rides. In California Adventures, we love Soarin Over California and Grizzly River Run, which both have fast passes. Note that the former is always freezing, so bring a sweatshirt, and you will likely get soaked on the latter. At night, the water is surprisingly warm. The Aladdin show is terrific.

Our feeling was that they just let far too many people into the parks at a time. the parades are great but be prepared to be jostled and end up falling back from the side as you can't risk your children being trampled just so they can see the disney characters. The show's and  experiences  they are selling are so expensive its prohibative. We paid   1700 for a 2 night stay at the disneyland hotel thinking it would give us the benefit of early entry to the parks but only a couple of the rides are open before 10am so its not worth it. we have a number of friends and family who have done both the UK and US parks and its worth saving your time and money for a trip to the US rather than France.

Hong Kong Disneyland Resort is easily accessible by MTR (Mass Transit Rail), and they have its own train line, that is, Disneyland Resort Line. The Transportation System in Hong Kong is very good, it only takes 25 30 mins to get me from Central(Hong Kong Island) to Disneyland Resort Station(Penny's Bay). The location of the Resort is the best among all disneylands, the whole resort is nestled among hills mountains with South China Sea at the south side overlooking the Hong Kong downtown Skyline.There are four Lands in HK Disneyland, namely, Mainstreet USA, Fantasyland, Adventureland and Tomorrowland. I enjoyed very much 3 of the shows, two being live shows (Festival of the Lion King and Golden Mickeys) and one 3 D Show (Mickey's Philharmagic). Although the rides at HKDL are limited in quantity, I don't see any lack of quality in the park. Space Mountain is one of the attractions I like most, the building is very futuristic and the ride itself very good. All the CMs (cast members) are very friendly and courteous. Hong Kong Disneyland has the largest Adventureland and the Jungle Cruise is nicely done. I have noticed that they have put a lot of effort in theming and landscaping. Tomorrowland looks really cool and beautiful particularly at night. Although the Sleeping Beauty Castle is a replica of the original DL, it reminds me the special magic and charm of the original Disneyland at Anaheim. The Parade and Night time Fireworks also worth seeing. Food is definitely quite good and affordable. The good news is that they are expanding.

I also highly recommend paying the extra $10 per person and buy the max pass. Link your tickets online with the Disney app and then buy the maxpass through the app too. You can get max pass's (like a fast pass but you don't have to walk to get the tickets or have everybody's tickets and less paper to lose) every hour or so. We had a system to get the ticket scheduled, arrive at the beginning of the return time and when redeemed and in the max pass line get the next one. By the time we went on the ride and walked to the next one it was max pass ready again. For the first time ever we did every single ride, the parade, and fireworks, and favorite rides twice in one day. Most enjoyable day ever! Started with Star Tours, Buzz Lightyear, and Matterhorn without maxpass' since we were early. Also use the photographers in the park. Much better pictures. Open the app and get the scan code and show the photographers and all the pictures they take are free and you can't download them from your phone! Disney has made it more affordable and enjoyable. The fireworks have snowlike bubbles after that really made it wonderful. So fun to see my child's face in awe (mine too)! Also, stop at the Holiday Bakery near the round in front of the castle.

FastPass is the way to go. We couldn't get onto Space Mountain till day 2 of our trip. But we used the FastPass for Indiana Jones, and Buzz Lightyear. It was wonderful to just walk to the front of the line and go inside. Must Sees: Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, any Disney Character you can. I was 4yrs old when I first took a picture with Gepetto. And at the ripe old age of 25, I was giggly again. If you must collect autographs be prepared to stand in line. Check out the parades. It was cool to see what little we did. Ride the Monorail too! California Adventure: A breath of fresh air. We just came back from Disneyland the week after Xmas and right before New Year's. Disneyland was so crowded that C.A. was practically empty. We got great pictures of the different characters. It was soooo fun. Ride the Tower of Terror. Make sure your stomach is empty and you went to the bathroom prior to riding. California Screaming is such a well planned roller coaster. It was great.  Walk the Hollywood backlots. We got to see Turtle Talk with Crush, Muppets 3D, and sneak preview the Monsters Inc ride. Oh and I took pics with FroZone.

On any given day any one of the popular rides (Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Splash Mountain, Mr. Toad's, the Haunted House, even the computers at two food carts   these are the rides that went off line today, at least for some time.) does go off line for some period of time. Chris acknowledged that the information on the frequency of down time is available; but Disney will not allow the information to be made available. The result   during any given hours of operation there is a probability that a ride will not be functioning for a portion of that time. Indiana Jones for example was off line at least four hours of the nine hours we were there. When perform renovations or routine maintenance Disney will pre warn visitors that ride is off line. But every day, according to Chris, safety protocols shut down rides. So, buyer beware, you may spend $500 (the average cost for a family of four for a day at Disneyland) but the kids may not get to ride the rides they went there for. If Disney provided the data, we the buyers could exercise judgement.","Disneyland_California"

Rather than watch your kids enjoy themselves at a children's attraction, Disney creates a world that is also very entertaining and nostalgic for adult to participate in as well. There are wild and tame rides, shows, music, static attractions, shopping, tasty food and games. I have been there twice, once in mid May and once in late September. Crowds were low and lines were short most of the time. Sometimes we could walk on a ride within 5 minutes but during the afternoon and on weekends, the lineups were longer. It is a pricey trip but I feel that it was worth it. Take snacks and drinks as the food prices in the park are high for those items. Learn about the Fast Pass system and use it, even if you don't think the park is busy. The morning is slower, so grab passes for the afternoon, when the lines are longer. The fastpasses will indicate a timeframe to return but we found that they are actually good for that entire day. We are planning another trip for this fall. If I could afford it, I would visit the park every year.","Disneyland_California"

I think is the content of their  magical  is not  magical enoughto me Disney is magical mainly due to it parade, I and my family had great fun with parades in Anaheim and Tokyo, is really magical and lively, the one over here... is just merely for the sake of Parade that they do the Parade, my daughter still enjoy it alot, but it fail to capture me and my wife heart, it just lack of that magical touch.2nd the food in the park, well... they really need to add some touch to that... it lack of variety and try to hard being  French  wayThe small world is close, and I am really disappointed with that, I try very hard not to mention the word small world to my daughter for that whole day.The bright side of this park is ... you do not need to wait very long for almost all the ride maximum 45 minutes, but usually 30 minutes will get you ride on, something you won't able to do in the other Disney park.However the Dream show at the park closing, does spark little magic out of me... it worth the wait for the park closure to catch the show, to me is even better than the parade itself.They got the right park, rides and everything but just need to put more magic portion in it to make it  MAGICAL ","Disneyland_Paris"

Both are excellent but get there EARLY for Fantasmic to claim a seat on the ground. The World of Color show offers fast passes for viewing spots but you still have to stake a section out once inside the fastpass area. The cast members are really what makes the park so special. They went out of their way to be kind and helpful when ever we had a question or needed help with something. California Sceaming is a great coaster. You get all the thrills without the bumps and jerks of some coasters. The Mattahorn on the other had is VERY bumpy and hard on the back neck. The best thrill ride is the Tower of Terror!

We spent most of our time in the age appropriate areas ... so ToonTown and FantasyLand. However, he enjoyed the Buzz Light Year ride and the Nemo Submarine ride in Tomorrow Land ... The Winnie the Pooh ride in Critter Country and oddly Pirates of the Caribbean.Of course the lines were a bit of an issue, especially for a 3 year old ... but that was to be expected. The indoor ones with slight entertainment in them such as the Buzz Light Year one was much better for him then say standing in line for the Nemo Submarine.

124811435,3,"2012-2","United Kingdom","Half term at Disneyland Paris is not for the feint hearted, a birthday treat for the kids it may have been, but definitely became an exercise in maintaining parental boundaries and discipline. I honestly don   t think I have seen so many chastised kids in one place! Basically this is a total retail experience with a few fairground attractions thrown in. Granted the kids loved seeing the characters and it certainly toughened them up to a more continental approach to the notion of queuing and taking your turn but increasingly as the days passed the whole experience became clearly over priced enticement to buy Disney products. Both Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios have limited rides for toddlers & younger children and all have long queues for a very short ride. The birthday tea party with the characters cost   17 per person (Kids & Adults alike) for that we got coffee, juice and a selection of pastries & marshmallows. The additional Birthday cake cost a further   31 (Booked through Disneydirect). It was a perfectly nice chocolate cake but certainly not a   31 cake! We put all that aside and accepted that like everything else the Disney mark up and increased costs in France played there part. The parks themselves were not fully open and many areas were being repaired or constructed, this certainly didn   t promote the magical experience promised. Our youngest was very confused that all the characters spoke French first and then English this was slightly distracting when trying to suspend his disbelief. While the hotel Cheyenne that we stayed in was comfortable and clean, the dinning arrangements were not an enjoyable experience. The Chuck Wagon cafe provided a buffet style arrangement that involved long queues again despite the laughable encouragement to reserve a table????. Once in the buffet area a free for all ensued which trying to navigate with two kids was a complete nightmare, then locate a free and cleared table to settle everyone to finally eat. Breakfasts were much the same. Oh and If you want a coffee in your room you will need to buy the  tea basket  7e for two tea bags, two coffee sachets, 4 UHT milk pots, 4 sugars and 4 Disney biscuits. I wasn   t naive enough to think that the magic kingdom was really as glossy and wonderful as its adverts would have you believe, however I wasn   t quite prepared to feel as though I'd been totally fleeced by a mouse.My advice if you really want the kids to experience Disney, then go to Florida, at least there   s less chance it will be cold and rainy.","Disneyland_Paris"

The first thing I would say is that not much has changed in the Disneyland park. There has been the addition of the Walt Disney Studio's, which has improved the overall experience of the attraction.The most dissapointing elements of the park was that the castle in the middle was surrounded by scaffolding and a lot of the area around the castle was bodered off with sign's stating that they were renevating for our future enjoyment. Unfortunately like most people since it has been nearly twenty years since my first and second visit, I am unlikely to benefit from any changes they are making. I also wondered why these imporvements were not carried out during the winter months ?The Thunder Mountain ride was also closed during our visit due to an accident the previous week, and the Rock and Roller coaster was also closed for some time during our visit.The Walt Disney studio's are more up to date and I felt more enjoyable. The back stage tour will leave you a little dissapointed if you have been to Universal etc as there is not much too it, but I would reccomend Toy Story land for the younger generation, and the rock and rollercoaster, the twighlight zone and the armageddon experience for the older people in the party.I enjoyed my time there, but feel the park has become a bit dated, and I think this shows with some of the attractions out of order or being renovated. Definately use the fast pass system to your benefit or you will be stood around for hours, and be prepared to be all 'Disneyed' out by the end of your visit !!","Disneyland_Paris"
264375748,5,"2015-4","United Kingdom","Okay let's start with the obvious   this place is busy like any other large theme park you will visit. In addition the food is slightly more expensive but miles better than any other theme park. Why people write these factors on reviews is a mystery but thought I would state the obvious.....The place is magical it's the only holiday destination I have been where I forgot I lived in the real world with a stressful job and completely relaxed and smiled. Seeing my children so happy will stay with me forever and I don't care how much it cost!The parades are amazing and must be seen, the magic show at night is amazing and really needs to be watched   only suggestion would be to make this an hour earlier because hard for a 5 and 2 year old to stay awake till 11pm! The shops are brilliant and the kids loved watching me buy them all the favourite characters. The rides are good and worth the long queues one or two need updating though which I am sure will happen. Go to Buzz pizza world for dinner great value for all you can eat including drinks and dessert 20 euro! If you are like us and will only visit here once or not often just take loads of money and live for the moment like we did. I can not wait to visit more Disney destinations! ","Disneyland_Paris"

452131878,3,"2017-1","United Kingdom","This is my second time at the park. We came December 2015 to see the Christmas Disney theme which was great but only had 1 day so decided to return and spend a couple of days this time. We stayed at the santa fe hotel which is not too bad. Nice, clean rooms. Staff are friendly and hard working however the value for money for food is not good at all. Merchandise is also over priced by quite a large margin (and that's in comparison to the Disney Store) Breakfast which is included is ok, but there is only 2 single slice toaster machines that are available to the hundreds of people in the hotel although croissants are in abundance and very nice. When staying in the hotel, you get 2 additional hours in the morning before the park opens. I must say, what a waste of time. Only a couple select kids rides were open and you are unable to even go to the bigger rides and queue to ensure you get on there quick to avoid the hour long queue times. When the whole park opened at 10.00 we made our way to big thunder mountain and queued for 15 mins just to be told the ride was closed due to technical faults. This was also the case for phantom mansion. When you bear in mind that most rides over by space mountain are being refurbished this doesn't really give you an option for the thrill seeking rides. I did feedback to the city hall in the park and they gave me a 'entry through exit' ticket to Tower of terror which was good however they failed to advise that this ride was closing 2 hours earlier due to screening the new star wars film attraction. They did change the date so we could use on the following day however When tried to use the ticket we were told to come back in 30 minutes due to a technical problem on this ride which we did only to be told the ride had now closed to all of these type of tickets due to only one lift working and a big queue! Foe me this wasn't the best visit and may be because we went more for the big thrill rides however the whimsical fantasy for the little kids is spot on. Although 15    for a face paint is a bit steep in any country! The fireworks never fail to impress and some of the staff are excellent. One in particular staff member Yann was extremely helpful and friendly and really enhanced our experience on the Aerosmith coaster. ","Disneyland_Paris"

Despite always being packed I love the ticketed fast pass system and over 3 5 days you can just relax and really enjoy the park with everything it has on offer. You really need to spend the time to appreciate everything in the park and not just rush it. You will miss things if you don't really take the time to walk around, check out everything really make note of every little detail. ","Disneyland_California"

We got in by 8:15, rode space mountain then fast passed it, rode Matterhorn, only about 10 minute wait, back to space mountain, fast passed star tours, rode buzz light year then star tours. You just have to work the fast passes. Didn't wait more than 10 15 minutes all day! Fast passed splash mountain and thunder railroad. Fast pass for buzz light year is like an extra meaning you can hold it and another fast pass for different ride at same time. Got to see second parade at 10:45 pm and it was excellent. Try to take break about 3pm if you're planning on coming back for late parade. It cleared out nice after fireworks. You can see some fireworks from tomorrow land. It's smaller than magic kingdom but it's so easy to get to each section quickly. Food is not that good and very expensive. Ask for cup of ice water and bring some with you in the morning. For those hoping it's like magic kingdom in FL, it's not. But space mountain is better here and pirates is longer and has about 3 drops, splash mountain is longer and it's a small world a it's own castle. We stayed at courtyard Marriott and it was about 7 minute walk to gate. It's nice to just walk up and in instead of waiting for bus at Disney world Florida then having long walk in. They are two different experiences but both great. ","Disneyland_California"

We went at the end of August during the school holidays. The park was busy yet none of the shops on main street opened until 1pm. All the decent restaurants (Walts, silver spur, blue lagoon) no longer open for lunch. Yet at the hotels all the a la carte restaurants are closed with only the buffet places open at night. The park looked tatty. The rides kept breaking down. The character greetings were a shambles. My 4 year old wanted to see a princess so we queued up at the allotted time to get a fast pass this took over an hour. We came back at the time on the ticket only to have to queue for another hour for the actual greeting  so much for fast pass.I would save your money and go to florida.

445063995,5,"2016-12","United States","Such an amazing place. Some tips... if you don't care for crowds, go to the park when it opens, it can get very crowded between lunch and dinner time. One thing we noticed, the vast majority of the crowd was polite and considerate of others, even when the park seemed at capacity. Most of the restaurants that took reservations were fully booked by the time we got there, so make reservations if you want to have a better eating experience. Last, but not least...wear comfortable shoes.As for Disneyland. I'm so thankful this magical place exists. It's still the best place to take children old enough to be familiar with the Disney movies. It's my opinion that there is no place (that I've been to) that has been able to carry our imagination so fully. It's clean, mostly organized, and filled with entertainment options as well. As adults, we couldn't ask for more. The only disappointment was in the food. Flavors, textures, and even food temperature was off. Maybe I have expectations that they would invest in excellent chefs to live up to the level of their franchise class   instead, time and time again over our 3 day stay, we were disappointed.That being said, we had the time of our lives soaking it all up. The highlight was the iconic castle transformed into an ice castle via lights and decor   breathtaking to see on person. See it at night too!We hope Disneyland remains open for many, many generations to come.Thank you Walt Disney for making your dream a reality shared with us all!","Disneyland_California"

So many smiles it melts your heart.The afternoon parade was great but noticed they have cancelled the lit up evening parades which I think is a pity but the highlight had to be the end of the night show in front of the Castle. The fireworks, lighting displays & water jets all set to a great story & music has to be one of the best overall displays I've ever seen but be prepared to arrive in front of the castle very early if you want unobstructed views for the 11pm finale.","Disneyland_Paris"

The longest we waited for a ride was 45 minutes at the height of the crowd. Disneyland is definately busier then California Adventure. We thought we have spent 3 days at Disneyland and 2 days at California Adventure but it was the complete opposite. Christmas time was awesome at Disneyland, smelled like gingerbread everywhere and they go all out with the decorations.

Australian theme parks have NOTHING on Disneyland... the thematic's of all the attractions and parks themselves make our local theme parks (which I've spent a LOT of time at) look like backyard side shows. The happiest place on earth isn't far from the truth... I can't say I've had a more fun 3 days in my life. From Arriving at 10am and staying on until after midnight on 2 of the 3 days we were there, we definitely packed in everything we could.Construction was happening when we were there, so that was a bit of a shame, we didn't get to see the iconic disney parades... but we were happy to see  world of color  and the final showings of  Fantasmic  A definite stop over for anyone visiting that part of California...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! and plan a minimum 3 5 days.","Disneyland_California"

If rides are your thing, I   d recommend going to PortAventura, if you want the Disney experience, go to Paris. It is an amazing place but my kids are probably just outside the ideal 'Disney' aged (10 13) and enjoyed 'Studios    more. Our trip was in high season, insanely hot, horrific queues, bigger rides shut for hours due to power outages, fast track system failed due to shut rides, lack of shade, park ran out of cold water to buy    and did I mention the queues?It   s big and sprawling (and expensive)   getting between from Disney to Studios takes 20  mins, getting to the bigger rides within each park about the same. When the parade is happening (and 20 mins before) you can   t get from one side of Disney Park to the other, not all rides are open until closing time...Suggestions: Get the app, the waiting time for rides is useful. If it is hot, plan the day and get out of the heat for a while; go as early as possible, maximise 'magic hour' (if you are staying in a Disney Hotel) but be aware, rides opened later than advertised; expect long queues and be patient.The restaurant food was excellent.","Disneyland_Paris"

The characters come out in Halloween costumes, most visitors (young and old) are dressed in costumes and it is just so much fun.

We queued for around 45 minutes for the Disney railroad and the wait time advised was 20.I know there were lots of special offers available last year, right up until Christmas, which must have attracted more people.We've done Extra Magic Hours in the past, where you could go on the rides that were open several times without a queue and be back in the hotel for breakfast within the hour! This time, we went only once and the park was heaving with people. The queue for Peter Pan at 8.30am was bigger than I've ever seen.

623434918,5,"2018-7","United Kingdom"," This is a combined review for both Disneyland Park and Disney   s California Adventure Disney has always held a place in my heart my entire life and I frequently visit Walt Disney World in Florida every year. This summer past however I went to the West Coast for a change of scenery and I could not pass up the opportunity to visit the park that started it all and it   s sister park Disney   s California Adventure. What can I say except the Disney experience here is the same as anywhere (amazing), however each park and resort has its own original charm and there   s something about Disneyland CA that makes it feel special. It may be a lot smaller in scope than WDW with it   s four theme parks and two waterparks but it is a beautiful park that feels familiar yet different and unique. The food is great, the rides are great and it   s great fun for not only the young but the young at heart too. California adventure despite its mixed reviews, I actually found myself enjoying very much as it was a breath of fresh air from WDW, all be it full of MGM (Hollywood Studios) and Epcot clones for the most part.  I could not recommend a visit to a Disney resort anymore highly whether it be Florida, California, Paris or any of their other global resorts. You get a similar experience at each but that is all the more reason to go. As the saying goes,    If it ain   t broken, don   t fix it,    and Disney have the theme park industry down to perfection. There   s nowhere on Earth quite like Disney. ","Disneyland_California"

Make sure you visit both parks and try to book your tickets in advance as you may get it at a much lower price. DON'T buy it from Disneyland's site, it is a rip off (about 70 pounds). Get it from other websites. Got mine from Attractiontix for 54 pounds and this included a fastpass too!","Disneyland_Paris"

The place is not that big, rides are not that thrilling, more for younger kids. My girl did enjoy herself. Food is expensive. Most rides are ok with bags. For those that are not, you just need to put the bags at the side, it's safe. Food is expensive, they did allow us to bring in our water bottles. The fireworks at the end was nice. However it's rather small so one day is enough. ","Disneyland_HongKong"

The castle alone was awesome with great detail and a dragon underneath. There were multiple unique spots like the Alice in Wonderland maze that made the park stand out in our minds. It was also amazing to compare the Disneyland Paris park to it's sibling next door, the Disney Studios Paris, which was terrible. This park is worth visiting if you are a Disney fan just for the details and theming if nothing else. ","Disneyland_Paris"
105226039,4,"2011-3","United States","Went on our first family trip to Disneyland Paris. Stayed at the Newport Bay Hotel. First thing, was the pick up from the airport by the Disneyland Bus, finding this was a bit of a challenge as the airport is huge and it wasn't marked very clearly. Followed the croweds and found it eventually, but be prepared for a wait. With young children this was a bit of a nightmare and some people don't like to queue. When we were picked up it wasn't a long journey to Disneyland, around 40 mins. Checked in and headed off straight away. Shuttle bus is great, but can get busy so be prepared to stand, but it is only a short journey. EVERYTHING in Disneyland is expensive, so be prepared to pay above the odds. The only thing we found to be slightly better value then home were some of the toys, i.e big Buzz Lightyear and Woody were around 30 euro each when they are nearly 50 at home. Eat in Cafe Mickey and Rainforest Cafe. Rainforest Cafe was great for kids to watch animals come alive etc, and food was ok, Cafe Mickey was great fun and bring camera for pics with characters, again food was ok nothing special. In both restaurants it cost around 120 for two adults and two children to eat, no wine, so speaks for itself. Confortable shoes are a must as you walk, walk, walk. We brought drink bottles for the kids and filled them each morning at the buffet with juice as things like drinks and snacks are outragious. Disneyland itself was great fun, Once Upon a time Parade is worth seeing and I would suggest getting the train that goes around the park. It's a lovely break from the walking and the kids and adults enjoyed seeing everything in the park. We were lucky with the queues we never fastpassed and the longest q was for Dumbo, which was about 20 mins. Buzz Lightyear Laser acadamy was brilliant and I would really recommend the Star Wars Tour, we didn't know what to expect and there was no q, we went on again, as it was brill and the kids loved it. There is a min height requirement of 1m 2in. Don't get carried away with shopping, even though there are tons of shops all decorated differently, all the products they sell are the exact same. Same t shirts, same jumpers, same toys, some do offers of the day at till points and you might pick up some things extra that you can use for gits. Overall it is a great experience, very tiring but kids loved it and to be honest so did we! Shop and eat carefully and your wallet might enjoy it too.","Disneyland_Paris"

12344027,5,"missing","United Kingdom","We travelled to disney paris on 30 12 2007 with coach company Buzzlines. The whole trip cost   595 (2 adults  1 child).Day 1   We departed from Dover (coach arrived bang on time) and travelled across on the ferry and down to our hotel (Novotel, Aulnay Sous Bois). The hotel was basic but filled our needs and was comfy. There was a steak house and an italian restaurant a stones throw away. The people on the coach were mainly young couples which surprised me as I thought it would be rammed with kids   there was one other family on board which meant my daughter had other children to play with.Day 2   Spent all day at Disney   Studios  Disneyland  Disney Village (10am to 12.30am!). The whole experience was totally fantastic. Thrill rides I recommend   Aerosmith rollercoaster, Terror Towers (only if you have a strong stomach!), Runaway train, Indiana Jones. Hint: Take full advantage of the fast pass system   it really does work and saves literally hours of queuing.As well as getting round the main rides it is essential to relax and take in the full atmosphere of the place (esp disneyland) and a ride on the steamer in Frontier land is a great way to do that. There is a fab balloon ride that we did not get on that takes off from Disney Village and rides right up into the air   the views must be amazing so if you can get to this then I would.It is impossible to do the whole of disney in one day (do able in two days) so if you are there for only one day don't try and rush round.We also watched the Animajique show which was very good, Armageddon ride was good too.As soon as we got to main street, disneyland it started to (fake) snow and was really magical. True disney magic.There are plenty of shops with lots of fantastic disney stuff so take plenty of dosh esp if going with kids   really top quality clothing and the trip is not complete without wearing a set of mickey  minnie mouse ears!The parades are wonderful. People start getting their positions about half an hour before the parade starts so if you want a seat on the kerb be prepared to wait some time. We were not prepared to wait as it was very cold (we watched the 9pm Fantasia parade on 31 12) but we still got a great view (and only waited around 5 mins) by standing on a grass bank   the parade was up high on floats so we probably had a better view than those at street level.You can greet and meet disney characters but the main ones get mobbed so be prepared to fight for your right to have a photo! As english we tended to try and queue but other nationalities had no such reserves so get in there!Other rides recommended by others on our coach were space mountain (thrill) and Buzz Lightyear (kiddies).We dined at Planet Hollywood in Disney Village which I can highly recommend. It was busy but we got seated within 10 minutes and the service was top notch. The french don't rush so whereas in england we would have been in and out within half an hour we enjoyed a good couple of hours having a full three course and a bottle of wine. After the last parade (near the magical fairy princess castle   which looks awesome at night) the street were filled with dance music and everyone was dancing and happy (helped by the plentiful stores set up selling glasses of champagne to celebrate the new year!).As you can tell i could go on for ages we enjoyed it so much. I haven't been to disney in Florida so I am not able to compare it to there although I have read other reviews and the US one seems to be even better   do not let this stop you from going to paris though.Only disadvantages   towards middnight the streets were rammed and queues in disney for refreshments were huge and cash machines were out of money. Suggestion: Take cash to last you a full day  Buy refreshments early on to last (bottles of water etc)  Take a ruck sack for purchases if you do not have a coach or car where you can leave them  Step outside Disney and seek refreshment in Disney Village which is less busy  Dress for the weather   you cannot enjoy it as much if you are cold  wet.Day 3   Our coach took us into Paris. We viewed the city via coach stopping off for photo opportunities. We saw the Arc de Triomphe, Champs Elyees, Musee D'Iarmee, Grand and Petit Palace, Opera Garnier, the Louvre, Notre Dame etc. We had a one hour boat trip along the Seine and ended up at the Eiffel Tower. The tower is huge when up close and a real breath taking experience. We did not have time to go up and the queues were very long ( I imagine this was due in part to it being evening and New years Day). Be aware of Algerian illegal immigrants trying to sell souvenirs and Algerian women offering you a piece of paper   Walk away they are trying to pick your pocket! Keep valuables and children close and enjoy the amazing sight of the tower. It is not expensive to go up the tower and we will definitely be returing to get up there. On the hour in the evening the tower lights up with millions of little lights   a proper spectacle.Day 4   returned home to England   again everything ran like clockwork   slightly longer on the way home due to passport control but we managed to fit in a visit to a beer warehouse!Biggest hint: Take a camera, memory card and batteries","Disneyland_Paris"

Baby care room was clean, neat and well equipped. I expressed milk there in the nursing room, warmed up the milk with the bottle warmer, used the high chair while I was warming the milk and fed my baby there too. Men are allowed in the baby care room, outside the nursing room. Got a little crowded when the dads, moms and some with grandmas when I was feeding my baby her milk. But still a very comfortable and pleasant place.Do download the app before you go to Disneyland, preferably in your own country.

We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel, and it was superb..My only complaint is with the food in the actual Park, huge lines, expensive, and the food was stone cold..The Disney name stands for quality, tradition, and is known the world over for it's love of children, and keeping the magic alive. Why would Disney endorse this dreadful food? If Disney needs to put the emphasis, and focus on the entertainment, hotels, etc, (Which it does with the most amazing stunning detail, quality, and perfection) Why can't you put the horrible food, served under your name and flagship, out to tender? McDonalds would be better than stone cold food..slow service, and disappointment.

We went during peak season when the park was incredibly full. We had three day park tickets, and went to California Adventure park on the first day and Disneyland on the other two (we did it in this order because we had an early entry day as part of our ticket, and early entry days are on specific days). We managed to see everything we wanted to see (most of the park  some things we decided to skip), and because of the touring plan, we didnt wait longer than 25minutes for anything!!!! AMAZING considering by midday some rides had 85min waiting times. The touring plans and reading I'd done made for a stress free trip to Disneyland. I'm interested to find out how the touring plan would go with kids, as it was just the two of us adults who went.

157332249,4,"2012-7","United States","It's Disneyland, so what can you really say. Everybody knows about it and what to expect. We did both parks (California Adventure) over two days and it was a small fortune. California Adventure was packed, the Cars attractions had recently opened, and most rides took an eternity to board. That said, the Tower of Terror was an excellent, lift you out of your seat ride.Disneyland was also packed the next day but, for some odd reason, the lines at the traditional rides (e.g., It's a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, etc.) weren't long at all. Space Mountain and Splash Mountain were long, but FastPass really worked well here.Tips:1) Hit FastPass early. It can really save you on the newer or popular rides.2) Meals are, as would be expected, outrageously high. However buying a kids meal for your self can save a bunch of money. Usually they are about $6 and include a water. It's about the only deal you'll find.3) Stay at the Candy Cane Inn. It's one of the cheaper lodging options you'll find next to the parks and it is very nice. Plus they have a shuttle that takes you to the park gate and back. So you save on parking as well.4) This one would be for the more adventurous, but there is a market (on the web and Craigslist) dealing with people who  rent  their multi day pass to park goers. It's a nice savings over the usual cost, as there rarely is a Disney discount, but it technically is against terms. Plus there is always the chance of fraud. So if you go this route, do your research.","Disneyland_California"

My teenage daughters were at the Park at 6.45 am and did not leave until 6.00 pm (but only to come back to hotel to shower and have a short rest) and were back by 8.00 pm for dinner and more fun. This happened for 4 days in total. The Disneyland staff in all the shops were magnificant and certainly selected to their character roles. California Park was great but wow the line to get a Fast Pass Ticket to the Cars Ride is amazing. Recommend you line up outside the main Park entrance at 6.30 am   6.45 am   no later. When you get through the Park entrance do the fastest quick walk you can do as there is fierce competition to to into the line or you will miss out after waiting 2 hours.

I recommend getting the early check In package deal as you can leave all your luggage at the train station and Its taken to your Hotel ready for collection when you check In therefore you get to enjoy the park straight away. This works on your journey home too. The hotel take your luggage to the station ready to collect prior to your departure so again you get to benefit from spending time In Disneyland If your train Isn't due to leave till late afernoon evening. We stayed at Hotel Santa Fe. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The room was a little bit dated but very comfy and It had a nice big bath with constant hot water ( enough for 4 of us to have a bath shower one after another) The downside was when you check In your given select time slots for breakfast and this can start as early as 6 a.m The breakfast itself was continental buffet. The queue did move fast and we were soon seated. Just be warned that your eyes suddenly become bigger than your belly! We ended up taking scrummy pastries and fresh bread rolls for snacks and lunch ( most people were doing this) The bus to the park Is a pretty awful experience. If you feel like the 10 15 min walk then I would suggest this. People actually pushed and shoved to fight for a seat even If you are right at the front of the queue. The minute the bus door opened we found It was a free for all. Not nice when a family are trying to stick together. The Parks themselves had amazing rides. Peter Pan was brilliant and also a Its a small world. Good for everyone especially younger families. The run away train was my favourite. a really fast train ride that goes underground and ends up on an island in the middle of the lake. My lot enjoyed space mountain ( I chickened out) Overall there Is something for eveyone young and old. The parades are out of this world and meeting the Disney charactors was fantastic. Be warned that to eat out Is extremelly expensive In both parks. We ended up In Disney Village most nights as there was a massive Mcdonalds that everyone seemed to go too. We were told by people that It was the favourite place to eat as the prices were near to normal. The food was good and staff were Ok. Top tip Is to get there between 4 and 4.30pm as this is when one of the parades run and after this everyone rushes In that direction and heads to Mcdonalds. Wednesdays are the best days to avoid as this Is when all the French people have a day off In that part of France.

604444408,5,"2018-8","United Kingdom","Wonderful for my six year  old grandson but this short holiday needs to be planned very carefully. Think about when you are going to go on the rides, what rides and when you are going to eat. There are fountains in the park but take bottled water to avoid dehydration. You may queue for over 45 minutes for some rides. So, consider a fast track pass although they are expensive. If you are staying in the park complexes get down early because you can get inside and on the rides for 830 am. Others cannot get access until after 10ish. There are plenty of good eateries but with kids, avoid those with menus described at the hotel concierge as more 'exotique'. Don't try to do too much the first day. You can soon become exhausted. Concentrate on a few good rides and get yourselves orientated. Going on the little railway is a good and relaxing way to get your bearings and start the fun. The firework display is a must. It is brilliant but does not commence until 11 pm. Just make sure that you get a clear view of the fairy castle. The afternoon procession is good too but be canny and get a good view point early, to avoid disappointment. My grandson   s favourite attraction was the Star Wars simulator and it is good. His second choice was the Peter Pan ride: quite enchanting! His third was the Alice in Wonderland maze. That surprised me but he insisted on returning to it for a second go. Others he liked included Pirates of the Caribbean which he thought a bit scary, Dumbo and the tea cups. Remember that there is a height requirement on the more    white knuckle    rides. I believe it is often 1.40 m. Get a photo on your smartphone of the kids or family with the many Disney characters dotted around the park. The staff are on hand to do it for you as well.

Before you could bump into characters rather than the organised times and long queues. I think it would be better to do over two days really. The parades were fantastic and the fireworks and display over the castle breathtaking. It's very expensive to eat and drink about 50    each but we had no choice. The Rock n Roll roller coaster was fantastic   would go again just need to save up!","Disneyland_Paris"

I recommend you get fast passes once you enter the park & then go back to them as the time draws near. It will save you a lot of cueing up especially in peak season.","Disneyland_California"

However, I find it necessary to write this warning to ensure nobody else is ripped off by North Sud Transport aka NAVETTE AEROPORT DISNEYLAND SHUTTLE. I paid a return fare in advance and was picked up from the airport. Unfortunately they did not pick us up for the return journey. I could not contact them, neither could the helpful receptionist at Santa Fe Hotel and finally I had to take a regular taxi at a cost of 120euro, barely making it to the airport on time. I finally got hold of North Sud Transport a few days later and was told my money would be refunded within 10days....that was two months ago...despite numerous phone calls on my part and empty promises on theirs the money has not been refunded. Also I did not receive one word of apology.The last time I rang they hung up. I would hate anybody else to have their holiday ruined like us and I find it hard to believe that they can continue operating and ripping people off.

397775873,5,"2016-7","United States","By far, the biggest problem visiting Hong Kong Disneyland in July is the oppressive heat. That, combined with our weekday visit, probably contributed to the relatively small crowds and short lines. Most of the rides had lines of less than 20 minutes. We have been to all of the Disney parks except the new one in Shanghai, and many of the rides at Hong Kong Disney cannot be found anywhere else. In particular, we really enjoyed Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Car (a combination of Big Thunder Railroad and Expedition Everest) and Mystic Manor. The park does need more fans and cooling mists in the waiting areas but that was our only complaint. We had our lunch and dinner at the indoor Chinese restaurant and we found the food good and the cold a c refreshing. There was no line to get into the restaurant.At only US$70 for an adult admission, we found Hong Kong Disneyland to be a very good value. Next time, we'll probably visit during a colder time, so we'll be expecting bigger crowds but at least we won't have to spend a small fortune on cold drinks.","Disneyland_HongKong"

52432828,2,"missing","Netherlands","I have visited Disney in Florida last year. A great experience, so the plan was made to visit Eurodisney. We also booked a stay in Hotel Cheyenne. To start with the hotel, it is poor value for money. The rooms are not very clean, the rooms (and beds) are small and the interior (the TV for example) are outdated. The breakfast is ultimate chaos. You receive a card where you see the time you are welcome for breakfast. The choice of food is not great. The price of the hotel is hugh, compare it with more expensive 4 or 5 star hotels. But the Cheyenne is a poor 2 star hotel if you ask me.I have different views abouth the stay in the park. We were there on a tuesday, friday and satyrday in November. The tuesday and friday were ok. Waiting times were not so long, from 5 minutes to max 20 30 minutes for the big attractions. Attractions are good. On saturday however, the lines were horrible. Up to 120 minutes. Luckily for us, we visited all the attractions and ran away from the parc. It was so crowded, i couldn't believe my eyes. What annoyed me most was the French element. The staff was arrogant, uninterested and not friendly at all. What a difference when i compare this to Disney World Orlando. There all the staffmembers are happy, helpfull and with their behaviour they add that magic to the Disney experience. Too bad that in France, such high standards are impossible. The prices in Eurodisney are also extremely high. A simple hot dog costs a fortune.Disney Village was a lot smaller then the village in Orlando. The restaurants in Disney Village are ok, but (ofcourse) quit expensive. Don't expect prime cuisine, but the burgers and steaks are ok. We eated in Planet Hollywood and Rainforest.My advice to Disney: improve the hotels, lower the prices and please fix the waiting lines. And maybe it is a good advice if Disney train there personell better. Learn them how to smile, be helpfull etcetera.","Disneyland_Paris"

CM's from Guest Relations were nice and helpful, but it didn't seem like the enthusiasm with other CM's was the same as DW. Glad I got to see it once, If I was in the area again might try California Adventure.

349355816,4,"2016-2","United Kingdom","Where do I even begin? I joined this site specifically to write this review. And Ive been thinking of what to write throughout the holiday. We went in half term, 15 19 feb 16. This was our second visit as a Family. We went last March but in term time and loved it, but felt we didnt get everything done so booked it again. We stayed in the hotel Cheyenne.To make this review make more sense, I need to say last year we loved it. It was amazing and we hadnt stopped thinking of going back since. Almost everyday it crossed my mind. Also we have two Children, at the time of the most recent visit the boys 3 almost 4, the girls 7 almost 8. Disneyland Paris is an unusual place and very hard to make a review of. There were times this week where I could have given it a 1 star rating, and times where 5 stars wouldnt be enough. Our first day there, Monday was ok, we got a lot done. it became apparent how busy it was compared to last year by the huge amount of people watching the parade. There are grown men and women out there that will push infront of very young children to watch characters in costume dance past! Shocking. But not disneys fault. Breakfast on Tuesday morning in the hotel Cheyenne was one of the most frustrating experiences Ive had recently. We had to sit in the bar squashed up the corner. It was then I noticed the Brits had taken over the place and it was like mcdonalds on a saturday afternoon. Pushing shoving swearing etc all for people to some breakfast. I also noticed (and had noticed Monday night) there were students everywhere. Not just a few, hundreds. The vast majority were golden but a few were horrible, noisy, running up and down the corridors of the hotel at 11pm etc. It was like this all week. Again not disneys fault as such.Wednesday was the worse day in the park. I hear the French have wednesdays off work? It would make sense. There was a point in the day, late morning iirc, where we couldnt do anything. We couldnt go on any rides (we were in studios at the time) they were an hour min. Ratoutoullie was a 180 min wait! You could barely walk around, ques to ride, eat, go to the toilet. The kids started getting really fed up as did we. It was at that point id wondered why I spent close to 2 grand on a holiday where we couldnt do anything. Despite that, come the end of the day we still managed to get a lot done. Although it was busy there were still shows and other rides in the other park we managed to get a lot done. Big bit of advice when its this busy is to book a table! We forgot for weds and ended up eating at 21:15pm. The year before there was never any need to book.We did cafe mickey and I cant reccomend this enough. The food is good, very tasty but nothing special. But you dont go for the food! You get to meet lots of charachters and they spend a bit of time with you too. Me and the wife said to eachother that this also saved us needing to que up in the part to meet charachters. Loved it. We also ate with the Princesses on Thursday. For   170 I wouldnt reccomend it. It was good, and my daughter did enjoy it but it just didnt feel like value for money. We met some mice things (sorry I dont know what they were, I think out of cinderella) We met snow white and a prince who were lovely. We met Cinderella, and I dont mean to be rude, I mean this from my kids point of view if that makes sense, but she was so unattractive that it just sort of killed the magic. The lady playing the role was French and lovely but you could just tell the kids wernt feeling it. We finished dinner and we were waiting for repunsal for an hour. The staff were politely trying to kick us out but we said we were waiting for her and not moving until she came. There was plenty of free tabels, and we saw repunsal visiting other tables. So for   170 we were waiting! She eventually came and she was lovely, very kind and really really looked the part. The food in there wasnt upto much. Very little choice and very posh. Almost too posh but I get the scene their trying to create. Id possibly avoid this if I was you. Just because of the price.   100 for cafe mickey was much much more fun.Thursday was the best day by far. It had been freezing all week. But Thursday it warmed up slightly. It was much quieter and we got so much done in both parks. Loved it. Friday, the day we were driving home. We had to leave about 6pm to make the eurotunnel so plenty of time to get stuff done. Unfortunatly it was like wednesday and was very very busy. Not sure why. But a great day all the same.To summerise there were times in this week I almost wanted to cry. There were times I laughed, looked on in wonder, felt real magic, loved rides and felt like a kid. Its a real up and down experience.The French staff at the park are lovely. So helpful. Im of the opinion disney wouldnt work if it were in England as the staff wouldnt be as helpful. Ive no idea what people have on the French?! Their great at Disney. The only problems we had were with horrible rude English holiday makers and students who were more like rodents! (im English too!)I could go on forever. If your thinking of going, go. I really didnt want to leave come Friday evening. Just expect some dissapointment along the way and make the most of it. The memories will last forever for you and your kids.","Disneyland_Paris"

Probably only 2 3 days max though for older families but really enjoyable visit with amazing light show at night. Disney Studios however were not quite as good, though still enjoyed most of the rides there. The only downside to the whole trip was the quality of the food. We got the meal plan which we know saved us a bit but the quality of food on offer was really poor. Far too much rip off very low quality junk food at most places was really disappointing. One of the buffet restaurants in the park (Plaza Gardens) was ok but nothing to write home about, however the buffet lunch on offer at the Restaurant Des Stars in Disney Studios was really poor. Clearly you don   t come to Disney for the food but they really do need to start giving much better quality for the money they charge. Also watchout if your meal plan includes breakfast. We stayed in Cheyenne hotel but were told we could not eat breakfast there in their dining room unless we paid about    12 more each. We had to go to a diner place in the parks, again this is poor, we only wanted a couple or croissants, not impressed by that setup at all.","Disneyland_Paris"

584370214,4,"2018-5","United States","I just want to share some impressions. First of all this is a beautiful park, the most beautiful Disney park I've been to. It is very different than the ones in the USA, in that the visitors are primarily from Europe and have a different style. Don't do a sit down lunch, as it will take you 2 hours. If you want to maximize your time, stay at a Disney hotel so you get the extra magic time, since ordinary visitors only get to enter at 10 AM! The fireworks are fantastic, so definitely do those. I didn't think it was worth getting the park hopper for one day so we could do Ratatouille   its a good ride, but not worth the extra money. Be prepared for long waits. We only did 5 rides all day! One end of the park is closed for the fireworks starting pretty early, so do Small World early. Relax and have fun   don't expect the same experience as in the USA.

167891836,5,"2013-7","Lebanon","Review Disney: take the time to read the below; 5 days experience noted in details; the best thing in Disney is the prior know how that will make or break your vacation.  LOGISTICS: the most important thing is the logistics; get a back bag to put the stuff in it; the    exclusive    Vittel water has a funny taste that kids may not like; so if you have kids that may need milk; get your water from airport before heading to Disney. Also Make sure that you reserve the restaurants before getting there for the best time; sunscreen, caps, etc   .. The Stroller is a must; bring one with you if it is light or rent one there; the fee is 15 euros per day and you get the chance to use it at both parks for same day if you plan to go on both parks. (keep the receipt with you in case someone accidentally takes your rented stroller)HOTEL: if you can afford it; stay in Disney hotels; the extra you pay is worth it. Starting from skipping the hassle of security; to queuing for tickets. I stayed at NY hotel and had the privilege of going back after the Parade at 7:30 for a 2.5 hours swimming, relaxing, dinner break before hitting the park again for the 20th anniversary show. Not to mention that every day you will have the Characters showing up at your hotel; thus a great opportunity for autographs and pics. TRANSPORTATION: you can reserve the VEA shuttle; it will cost 20 euors plus or minus per person; if you are agroup of 4; take a taxi; it will get you to your hotel in half the time. if you are staying for a longer period; then the Shuttle experince is nice for the kids and offers them an opportunity to see other hotels. no need to reserve online as the shuttles are not always full; they leave every 45 minutes and are easy to detect at gate 8. RESTAURANTS: again; if you can afford it; if you are staying in Disney buy the half board option; you get the choice of best restaurants at the park and lots of them have a buffet that is great for kids tastes and choice especially if they are coming from abroad. The best timing is breakfast at 9:30; lunch at 3:00 (unless it is at Caf   Mickey; then you need to reserve earlier as characters stop showing at 3: pm) and dinner at 9:30. This gives you the best time to watch the Parades; have fun, and actually have fun. Again if you can afford it; a reservation at Auberege De Cendrillon is worth the time; (the food is average); yet your kids will meet 3 princess at once! You can reserve your restos at the Concierge or at the entrance of the park on the left hand side when you enter. PARADES: unfortunately; the Parade at Disney is a nightmare; you have to sit as early as 6 pm to reserve a place at the sidewalk to enjoy the show; what make things worse are the people who careless about children and stand thus preventing kids from seeing the show. Make sure that you reserve a decent seat at 6:30 pm in the shade. You don   t have to worry about the 4 pm Parade at the studios as they start at 4pm; with lots of space, enjoyable experience and much much less people. CHARACTERS AUTOGRAPHS the Walt Disney Studios is the best for collecting them; you can have access to marry Poppins, Cinderella, Stitch, Mulan, etc    with relatively accessible and fast ques. The princess Pavillion is nice; you have to go there to get the tickets for the appointment; the distribution times are 10:30; 11:45; 13:45 and 16:45 (next to the Mulan windmill). Go there 15 minutes before; if you don   t want your kids to que for distribution; take their access tickets for Disney and just show them how many you have. you will get access for the number of park access cards you show them. they can   t tell which princess timing is; so you have to count on luck. RIDES ATTRACTIONS if you have kids less than 5 or daughters; then Fantasyland is your destination; avoid Dumbo trap and Carrousel; go for the it   s a small world section, Peter Pan, Railroad station, Pinocchio world, sleeping beauty, dragon dungeon, Alice   s maze, Le Pays de Conte de Fe. If you have boys; go to Adventure land and have fun with the Pirates rides as well as Discovery land with Buzz. If you have a mix crowd; best is: peter Pan, it   s a small world, Alice   s maze, pirates rides and boats plus Buzz world. STUDIOS: depending on the weather forecast; choose your visit to coincide with windy or rainy weather as most of attractions are indoor; start with Animagique; Cinemagique; Stitch Live, Disney play house (for kids less than 5); the action motor show and dine at the restaurant of the Stars where you get to watch Ratatouille show. Remember the Parade is at 4 pm; so leave the motor stunt show till after the ride. If you have the time; go to the Hollywood production set. Face paintings is a must for kids as it gets them to live the experience; while at the Studios it is conveniently at the entrance; unfortunately in the park it is inconveniently behind the Castle!the Studios close at 7 pm; so you have teh time to watch the other Parade if you would like to run for it. however, if you end up shouting on your kids and drag them to watch the Parade (as we saw some parents doing); then it wont be that memorable experience for them!!! FAST PASS: asked for an upgrade to a Suite while at the hotel; the cost was not cheap; yet significantly lower than when I wanted to book the suite over the phone. Bottom line, you get an easy pass and a fast pass throughput your stay at Disney. The cost of the upgrade was less than the cost of 4 Fastpass of 240 euros per day for a party of 4. It was WORTH it big time; you pay more, but believe me, cost efficient in Disney does not mean Cheapest; it is Value for money and we had the chance with the Fast pass to take some rides twice, have a breakfast at a designated area in the hotel (less crowded) with Characters showing up. I say what the hell; if it is a once in a life time vacation for your kids; do it the right way and save the extra 100 euros per month for the upgrades that will make a BIG difference for kids and a more relaxing experience for Adults. THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY SHOW: this is a MUST WATCH; do not kill yourself trying to get closer to the round about where it is hectic, crowded and again careless adults obstruct the kids eyesight. Stand at the end of the Main street facing the Castle. I am talking from experience, had 4 nights to watch; the best was the two ones that we distanced ourselves a bit to the back; less crowds; better visibility and you don   t get smashed when the show is over. Don   t kill yourself videotaping it; you will find much better quality on YouTube for your kids watching later; take only some pics for the little ones watching it. i spent more times watching th enchantment, magic effect and expressions on my kids faces rather than the actual shows. Finally I would say that Disney is a vacation for kids; a memorable experience; do NOT try to impose the rides that you may think they will like; if they prefer to stand 20 minutes looking at the dragon so be it. Again, I reiterate that you consider where to stay; it I true that the intention is the park and the hotel is only a stop. Yet, with the right hotel, services, you can relax more, charge up faster and be ready for the adventure. We stayed 4 nights  5 days and it is more than enough; the minimum is 3 nights ( you need 8 hours for teh park including dining and resting and 6 hours for teh studios as it is tied to the shows); I won   t recommend any stay less than 3 nights unless you and your kids are related to Ussain Bolt and have the genes of marathon runner Gebri Selassie.","Disneyland_Paris"

It is however very expensive, and invariably there a big crowds. The day before we went, the website rated the potential  Busy ness  of our day as  ghost town ; ie not very busy. Don't believe it! There was wall to wall people and the waiting times for some attractions were close to two hours. After forking out over $150 that must have been horrible. The Max pass allows you to skip the main queue and get on a faster one. Although some of the waits were still 20 minutes, and there was some restrictions on its use, our day in Disneyland was improved immensely by having it. So if you think its a waste and a rip off to spend yet another $10, if you want to enjoy your day it is a MUST purchase. In fact on busy days I'd avoid going, but for overseas travellers such as us, you probably don't have the flexibility, so bring your own lunch and drinks and what you save at the food outlets, spend on the Maxpass.","Disneyland_California"

This is worth a visit for souvenirs and dinning out. Whilst there we went to the Wild West Buffalo Bills show, which i can not recommend enough. It was a fantastic show, the food was good and i can not praise the staff enough. A lot of thought has been put into it, and a trip to Disney land would be a waste without going to see this show. It does say that it   s not recommended for asthmatics, and being an asthmatic myself i did not have any problems. We choose to dine at King Ludwig   s castle which was value for money, apart from the size of the meal was on the small side and drinks were expensive. I was very pleased with my overall experience of the Disney park it   s self. It always seemed very clean; i don   t remember seeing one piece of litter (unlike our English amusement parks). They   ve put a lot of effort in the main street which consists of shops and food outlets. Whilst in the park I didn   t spend much time in queues compared to what i was expecting due to it being such a busy time of year. I would recommend using the fast pass service which is available for all Disney visitors; it cuts out so much time!Haunted Manor was a fairly good ride, not very scary but they have made an effort with it. My favourite part being the head statues that seem to talk and the holograms of ghosts and ghouls. Indiana Jones Temple of doom was very good but once again not very scary. Pireates of the Caribbean ride was very good, and liked all the detail they had put into the ride. Also got to meet Jack Sparrow just near this ride, who was a very good impersonator of the real one. Peter pan ride and Pinocchio ride were alright although a bit basic, but then these are rides for children. Its a small world ride was very good and impressed with all the different figures from around the world... really did get the sense that its a small world after all! Space Mountain mission 2 was very fast and defiantly liked all the lighting effects at the end, but found it bashed me about a bit to much, giving me a headache for the rest of the day. Star tours was very impressive. They have put a lot of effort into the different figures whilst you queue up such as C3P0 and R2D2. Honey I shrunk the audience was defiantly worth a visit and was amazed at the effects used with the cinema. Overall i was very pleased with my day in the Disney Park and would defiantly go back again.We also saw Cinderella and prince charming on our travels. We spent new year   s eve in the Blue Lagoon restaurant which is based next to the pirates of the Caribbean ride. We had an 8 course meal which was fantastic although it wouldnt have been to everyone   s taste. They had different types of entertainment to keep you amused to. Would recommend the fantaillsion parade, where all the loved Disney charters are on floats lighted up.I must say that i preferred the Walt Disney studios. I thought the stitch live was fantastic and was gob smacked when stitched started to talk to the people in the audience (it really is live). Both the Animagic and Cinemagic were very good and well worth a visit. I was amazed at the car stunt show, very impressed with all the stunts and once again recommend watching this! Was a bit disappointed with the Nemo ride, considering we queued for 2 hours.... they could have done a lot better i think. The Hollywood tower of terror was defiantly the scariest ride at Disney Land, and it doesn   t help being able to see over the park just before the lift drops you to the ground!Sorry for the long review, but really didn   t want to leave anything out. To conclude any person aged 1 to 99 will find some magic at Disney land and well worth a trip!!","Disneyland_Paris"
348173954,2,"2016-1","United States","Our family travels to Disneyworld in Florida 3 times a year for a week each trip. We love it and in WDW everything runs smoothly, even when lines do hit peak times. We were in LA this January for business reasons and went to Disneyland with my youngest (11) just because a. it is Disney, b. it is an amusement park and c. we were in the area. Well, let's say it is an under amusement park, the rides are almost the same as the ones we love in Florida but with crappy surroundings, cranky and poorly dressed (time to buy new uniforms!) cast members, no music, no festive atmosphere. It barely feels Disney, and it does not begin to feel  magical . As my daughter put it, she wanted to leave after 2 hours in the park (and the day we visited the lines were ok):  this is like what would look like if you were having a very bad dream about Magic Kingdom . I don't get how so many people still love Disneyland, I honestly feel bad about them since they are obviously deprived of fun choices or seeing the place clouded in their memories of the past or obviously we don't get it and they do. But for us to even begin to enjoy this place, they would have to make a major clean sweep in this park (trash sits everywhere), hire and train happy people, give them a nice, new looking uniform, put music and events in the park, fix the potholes, clean up their act with fast passes, buy new umbrellas and park fixtures, train the personnel at Town Hall, open new table service restaurants, add a Main Street  smell , and so on. No wonder the two parks are managed by totally separated companies   who ever Disney hires to maintain and manage this park should be let go, and bring in the big guns from Florida.","Disneyland_California"

In fact there was hardly any magic at all)Extremely Expensive. (most of the clothing and gifts over    30) and as for the restaurant prices over the odds. Needs a Serious Update lacking paint and some of the rides are tired. Just looking around this park you can see it needs some serious tender loving care. Refurbishment is needed. Dust (accumulating from 1992 properly). Out of date rides and displays. And Please try to avoid the Princess Pavilion. (if you want to meet the princesses you can only meet ONE but in order to do that you need to get to the park early and book your reservation to meet them. Booked to meet the princesses at 10:30 and we could not meet them until 7:45. My partner met Cinderella and did not want to. Merida and Belle was there she was crying becouse those are her favouritesThe Staff in the princess pavilion work on a bizarre system  One Princess chosen at random for each person but your not allowed to know who you're going to meet). Once you have met them you Can NOT! Meet another one. I fought to try and get my partner to meet Merida and Belle (that was there) but the Extremely Rude staff that was very Unsympathetic would not allow thisI Told them (This is not Disney. Disney it's about making people's dreams come true not making people cry) But on a positive some of the rides were quite good and the que length. It was our first time to Disneyland after years of wanting to go BUT it was not a Good experience. What ruined it for us wereThe StaffPrincess Pavilion The Prices  buy the park ticket online the Flexi 2 park ticket   57 The Condition of the parkMost of the rides were not open. Positives...The ridesThe meal But most of all DONT go when it's raining the princesses don't come out and they don't do the fireworks. And there was no Big paradeBut I certainty hope and with your experience at disneyland is better than ours. I rate this park a 3 5 for not living up to its own expectations of creating people's dreams come true and failing to make the Magic happenI'm sure Walt Disney wanted for this.","Disneyland_Paris"
351732335,5,"2015-10","United States","Who wouldn't love Disneyland. Such a magical place. Be sure to purchase tickets in advance and forgo the lines when you get there. Formulate a plan for the park as to utulize every moment. Lines get long midday, so arrive early and be patient as the day goes on. Ride the most popular rides during parade times, lines will be shorter. If you have young kids, the character breakfast is the best way to see some of the most popular characters without waiting too long, and the food really is worth the extra expense. Good quality food and kid friendly. Many rides offer a 'fast pass' take advantage of them to make the most of your time. Food can get pricy, so incorporate that into your budget, you can always have food in your car, but you waste so much time getting out there, find more of a snack bar place for lunch and dinner rather than a sit down meal. Have a list of 'must do ' attractions so you don't just wander aimlessly. Enjoy","Disneyland_California"

From the grumpy parking man (we parked preferred), man at the ticket office implying that maybe the max pass add on was too expensive for us, to the even grumpier older blonde haired lady wearing black tuque named Cheryl scanning tickets and taking photos. It was awful!! The Castle is under construction, so there   s a tarp with a cartoon picture of the castle. Definitely not the same! Everything in the park is way overpriced, unless you   re a Season Pass holder. Most of the rides were down today (Feb 20th) and some breaking down and the ride operators were so rude when letting us know that the ride was shut down. Seemed like they hated their job and I noticed all of the negativity and so did my children. We rode 3 rides and decided that enough was enough. We left in the worst mood and what a waste of money!! We spent $720 USD which was close to $980CAD for 3 hours! The staff needs a reality check and learn some workplace positivity especially when you work at Disneyland!! ","Disneyland_California"

During September and October they have a Halloween celebration each night and it's crazy busy and things close early to cater for this so be aware.We had a few rides break down that we wanted to go on but I guess they are very old so it's going to happen. What I can say is this park is hot, hot, hot. There is very little shade and nowhere to cool down. It's not like Universal that has covered waiting areas. Most line up areas are out in the sun.  Jedi training was great and worth the effort. My daughter loved it.   star tours is awesome.  toy story ride is loads of fun too.  Parade was excellent. Get a good spot close to the rope and sit down till it's starts.   space mountain and madderhorn are old rides now.

But I'm just wondering has the 20 years caught up on it. I was really looking forward to the Peter Pan ride, but it's closed, and that was not the only ride closed or having techinical faults. Maybe the park should consider a week closed down, get it sorted and open up working! We were in 2 rides that shut down half way through   Buzz light year and Snow White   a 5 year old doesn't particularly like being in the dark with a witch in her ear!!! And I agree with one other reviewer, the staff need an injection of Disney magic, some are very gruppy!!! I think it would be worth advising guests of attraction close downs in advance. And the food in the park is shockingly expensive!! But it's Disney, that happy go lucking feeling gets you through the expenses, it's just the closed rides and gruppy staff that take the edge off the magic. But regardless I'll be back, bring on Thunder Mountain!!!!!","Disneyland_Paris"

651327634,5,"2019-2","United States","A little over two months ago, my girlfriend discovered that Disneyland Park was planning another    Disney After Dark    hard ticket event, this time themed after Valentine   s Day and referred to as    Sweetheart   s Nite   . We were well aware just how popular these events have been in the past, so we immediately purchased our tickets online via the Annual Passholder pre sale option. After much anticipation, the night had finally come. Upon arrival, we parked in the Mickey & Friends Parking Structure, made our way past the security checkpoint and quickly boarded a tram to take us to front gate.Once we stepped through the gate, we were both handed special lanyards, wristbands and brochures. By this point, the time was around 8pm and while the event itself did not officially start until 9, guest mix in had begun two hours prior. This provided us the opportunity to plan out our evening (while waiting in line at the Main Street Starbucks). We would continue down Main Street, coffee in hand, to the park   s central hub. We immediately noticed the painted facade outlining Sleeping Beauty Castle (which was interestingly under refurbishment). From there we headed into Adventureland and hopped aboard Indiana Jones Adventure in no time flat, which is unfathomable during normal park hours. We would also grab a bite at the brand new Tropical Hideaway, where assorted baos (or breaded dumplings) make up most of their menu. A steel drum band played while we enjoyed our delicious snack.We would then leave for New Orleans Square where we rode Haunted Mansion (again in no time at all) and experienced the first of many holiday offerings in the Mark Twain Riverboat, which was transformed into a    Moonlight Cruise    featuring a jazz band performing on the bow of the ship. Prior to this evening, I had yet to experience the historic riverboat at night, which made the voyage even more magical.Once we returned to    port   , we hastily headed for Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in Frontierland     again little to no wait. The shockingly short wait times would become a running theme throughout the evening. To those who haven   t experienced Big Thunder at night yet, try it and see for yourself.Following the heart pumping train ride, we would revisit the central hub and continue into Fantasyland, where we would enjoy dinner at Red Rose Taverne. The    Beauty and the Beast    inspired eatery   s seasonal special featured Minnie   s Surf & Turf Artisan Flatbread for Two, which was fairly reasonable in price, as well as positively scrumptious (... and filling). We would ride Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Pinocchio   s Daring Journey, Storybook Land Canal Boats and Alice in Wonderland in quick succession before heading over to    it   s a small world    to catch some of the    Royal Ball   , where guests were given the opportunity to dance with their favorite Disney princes and princesses, including Cinderella and Prince Charming, Ariel and Eric, and Tiana and Naveen. We would soon discover where the vast majority of the crowds had gathered. Rare (but popular) Disney couples characters, including Hercules and Meg, and Milo and Kida (from    Atlantis: The Lost Empire   ) had garnered much attention from avid fans.Romantic Disney movie backdrops had also encompassed the area, for which guests could pose for pictures with their friends and or loved ones. These elaborate photo opportunities included (but were not limited to) the    I See the Light    lantern scene from    Tangled    and    A Whole New World    magic flying carpet scene from    Aladdin   . They too commanded extremely long lines     so much so that we chose to forgo them altogether in favor of our walk on attraction marathon.We continued into Tomorrowland where we would ride both Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters and Space Mountain with, you guessed it, absolutely no wait whatsoever!To conclude our evening of    after dark    fun, we jumped in the line at    Get Your Ears On: A Mickey and Minnie Celebration    held within the Tomorrowland Terrace.Before exiting the park, we were able to snap a photo with Horace Horsecollar, which put a stamp on our perfect night.I would strongly recommend    Disney After Dark    events to adults looking for leisure time within the park. Since only a finite number of tickets are sold, the typical hustle and bustle is kept to a dull roar. That being said, I would also advise guests to choose early on in their evening between the rides attractions and the character meet and greets special event offerings as it is almost impossible to do it all in only four hours.

This meant that the things to do were limited and all the crowds were funnelled towards the same attractions, meaning large queues for everything.

It took just 11 mins from CDG to Disney on the TVR high speed train so that works out around 8.5 euros per minute. What a disgrace! I will never complain about British Rail ever again! Taxi drivers ripped us off too, they either left the meter off and charged what they liked or whatever it said on the meter, they added on an extra couple of euros cos there were 'four of us'! We took taxis to the nearby Val D'Europe shopping center which was very good but avoid the outlet malls as they are very very expensive.Loved the theme parks but the whole experience is not a patch on the USA and Japanese versions. Don't get me wrong, we did enjoy our weekend and I'm not tight or miserable but I hate to be ripped off and that was what this trip was all about from start to finish. Disney studios is much smaller than the Disneyland Park so choose to do this one if you have less time in the day (or are tired!). The rides are great but not many with the fastpass facility.

128619805,5,"2012-4","United States","We visited in April, 2012 during spring break (one of the busiest times of the year). The following strategy helped keep us out of long lines and saved us $$$:1. Buy your tickets in advance through AAA or the Disneyland website. AAA may have the advantage of free parking. Multiple day tickets include early admission on one day. For example, if the park opens to the general public at 8:00am, you get in at 7:00am. Use the hour for those rides that do not have the FASTPASS option.2. The Disneyland website has a list of rides offering FASTPASS. This is a great way to avoid long lines on popular rides.3. Disneyland allows you to bring food and beverages. We packed lunches snacks each day and brought refillable water containers. This saved a bundle and meals were much healthier.4. Parking is $15.00 per day. There is also parking available at the Downtown Disney lot (free for the first 3 hours).5. If you are lucky enough to be in line or on a ride that breaks down (yes, lucky enough...), Disney cast members may give you a get out of line free pass for up to 6 people. We received several of these and were able to walk right up and board rides without waiting. Use these passes for rides that do NOT have FASTPASS (such as Toy Story Midway Mania or Finding Nemo); otherwise they are basically (anytime) FASTPASS tickets. 6. On days when you don't have early admission, go on the busiest rides (that don't offer FASTPASS) first thing in the morning. Disneyland seemed to be busiest in the afternoon and least crowded in the morning and evening.7. Our teens loved Toy Story Midway Mania, Space Mountain, Star Tours, California Screamin', and (of all things) the old shooting gallery in Frontierland!8. Do not miss the  World of Color  show!!!

We ate at the Lion King theme resturant   it was typical theme park food   unremarkable, but a meal.We also visited the Disney Studio Park. We didn't find much there to amuse us, and we can't recommend it for the money paid.Overall, it was a fun place to visit   we enjoyed the day, without too much expectation.","Disneyland_Paris"

A standard adult ticket is priced at HKD4500 while the seniors ticket is only HKD100. This is my second visit to the Disneyland Hong Kong   2009 is my first visit and many new attractions have been added into the theme park.Again, due to time constraint, I had to be very selective on the rides and here are some of the rides that me and parents went through:Adventureland  Jungle Rivercruise (Quite an interesting tour along the river with animations and sound effects along the way, choose between Chinese, Cantonese or English speaking tour guide   the queue for English is always the shortest, in 2009 it was the shortest, and in 2013, it is still the shortest queue among all other languages)Toy Story Land  RC Racer (OMG   when you reached the peak and the plunging down feeling is simply breath taking)  Slinky Dog Spin (too slow to be exciting, the Rev Booster in Ocean Park is more thrilling)Mystic Point (the latest attraction in Disneyland HK which was opened in 2013)  Mystic Manor (do not miss this mystical adventure in a carriage that can hold 6 passengers   very brilliantly planned and executed)Grizzly Gulch  Runaway mine car (this roller coaster is not too fast, that I could hold my video camera and still take some videos, however at some point, the car will move backwards)FantasylandWe did not spend any time at this area as the queues are super long   possibly due to the fact that the attractions here are more suitable for the young children   however back in 2009, I managed to hop on to the It's a Small World rideTomorrowland  Space Mountain (I would say this is the most exciting ride of all   my mum backed out just before our turn while my dad came out feeling dizzy after the ride. As there is not much lighting, you can never anticipate what's coming next   sharp turns, uphill and downhill, etc)  Stitch Encounter (an interactive video session, good for the young children   again this attraction is conducted in different languages, Chinese English and Cantonese)Main Street USA  Flights of Fantasy   our trip to Disneyland ends with the parade which was not available when I visited in 2009, I still remembered in 2009 I watched High School Musical Parade instead (do bring your child to the Art of Animation   I have been to this gallery in 2009 but decided to skip that as my parents were tired)TIPS: Buy your tickets online or from kiosks at Central MTR Station or any K store convenient stores to avoid the queueHow to get there:Take an MTR to Sunny Bay Station (Tung Chung line)   then change train and take to Disneyland Resort Station","Disneyland_HongKong"

Too many shops, most items over priced. The tills are festooned with sweets and the doorways are crowded with small things that kids want to pick up! This parental unfriendly layout is in all of the shops, one wonders if this is deliberate? Unsuprisingly the shops are not too crowded, but if you want to go on a ride or visit an attraction or have a meal beware! My advice is to take your own food and queue for the rides.

Also, entering the place wasn't a hectic despite the heavy crowd as everything was very well organised.The food and stuff there were quite affordable, to my surprise, and I bought a number of souvenirs there. Only downside is that it's nowhere near the city or town, it's isolated, so you definitely have to eat there. The food here is still OK.Coming to the rides and all that, it's kind of cool and all that. However, be prepared to be faced with screaming kids and rude tourists who will just cut the queue or not making way for you to pass. Also, some of the more popular rides required quite a long wait   eg the car ride. Everything is beautiful here and well maintained here. I'm not sure if it's myself, but I was a little disappointed. Although there are sufficient rides and attractions, however, I felt that it could have been expanded more to cater to the large crowd and avid photographer like myself. All in all, it was quite a enjoyable experience, but I felt that more improvement could be made.","Disneyland_HongKong"

Disneyland is the original Disney and had everything we expected, but is still overwhelming. We are addicted to the magic of Disney and on this trip we felt that we really made the most of our tickets. We were there at a quieter time of the year and found that on weekdays we were able to access rides with only a short wait without using Fastpass. On the weekends, we used the Fastpass and during our visits were able to ride every ride and visit all the attractions. We left feeling like we had done it well and it was a great visit.

31088609,5,"missing","United States","Still a great time for kids. It was fun, May was a good time to go. Most of the families there had kids that werent in school yet and that made for some super short lines on the bigger rides in the morning up until about two in the afternoon. Next time we will go during the off season again for sure and during the middle of the week again. Nothing much has changed since my parents took me when i was younger. I took us about 2 1 4 days to see everything (not including California Adventure) with the two of us, a 15 year old, 10 year old and our 10 month old daughter. Feeding and changing the baby as we enjoyed the park wasn't as bad as i thought it was gonna be. In the morning we could usually ride two rides and then walk to the next ride before the fetus needed something which wasnt bad at all. What we did worked out pretty good if you have a young one, the first day we stayed away from the kids ride and tryed to hit all the big rides (baby went on most of them) and then the 2nd day we tryed to stay on the rides that the baby would enjoy such as the Flying Dumbo and what not. By the third morning all we had left to ride was Its a Small World and Mr. Toads Wild Ride and that worked out great to hit in the early moring also because there quite popular when theres mostly little kids in the park. After that we headed to the California Adventure Park. The catch there is i guess we didnt need a park jumper pass exept for the last day??? If ya had older kids i could see getting one if you had dinner reservations at one of the other parks.Use the Photo Pass people, made for some great pictures once we got home. It's expencive thats for sure but well worth it. A good tip, if you buy yourself some of those hybrid sneaker sandles flipflops they make now... wear them everyday and try to walk as much as you can in them. I got the worst blisters on the sides of my feet i'd ever had. Limping around in pain wasnt much fun. Come prepared for some heavy walking. Our best things, Indiana Jones, Splash Mountain, Jedi Training Academy was cool to watch, Meet The Princesses was fun for my younger daughters.Have fun guys.

There is soooo much to do so wear comfy shoes as you will be walking a lot. The kids could have obviously stayed for days but we found that 3days was enough (kids aged 9,10). The rides for the bigger kids (adults) were good too with Space Mountain rating the best! The kids rated the StarTours ride the best going on that one 4times! So for kids that like Starwars that ride is for you..Some of the rides have fast pass options but don't leave that too late to arrange as they do cut their availability off at certain times of the day.

Wow what more can I say, it was amazing, her dreams came true and that's what the trip was intended for.We stopped in the hotel Cheyenne and got the passes for both Disney parks included, this also enabled us to have extra magical hours each morning 8 10am in the Disneyland park, this is worth making the most of as it's quieter and you can get on the rides before the park opens to the general public. We didn't meet many characters in the park as the queues where mental, if you want to meet a Disney princess and its pot luck as to which one is in the princess pavilion you need to join the queue first thing, we didn't do it as the queue was over two hours long every time, others where sending partners to sit in queue at 8am for when it opened at 10.30am but as my daughter never asked we didn't bother and occupied her with other things. We booked a character did in experience instead and meet the popular characters this way.Insides Disney the prices are ridiculous but then it's a captive audience and people will pay as we did, as we had no fridge in hotel to store water, pop to keep cold to take with us we had to buy it inside    3.50 for a 500ml bottle of coke.Take the half board that is available at a extra cost when booking unless you drop on free half board as we did, they include most of the all you can eat buffets on all sites and you are best reserving a time. The best we enjoyed the most was bills bons in Disney vial leg, all tex mex food and a good Childrens selection. We did character dining in Disneyland hotel so we knew it was costing more than the half board allowed, so you can out to to eat in more expensive restaurants. You also get a tea time treat in the parks between 3 6pm and you got a small drink and magnum ice cream bar or sugar doughnut which where both as nice as each other, best time to get this in Disneyland is around 4.30pm and then take up a spot on the kerbside of Main Street ready for the 5.30pm parade.If going when frozen sing along is still on make sure you get there early and dress your girls In princess dresses to get special seating preferences for the show. The show is not to be missed, my little girl was on cloud 9.The night time dreams laser and firework show onto the castle again not to be missed, timing, effects and show is spectacular. People start to get there spots for this from 2hr before so be prepared to sit and wait, get close to the front so you can see it all. We did this twice the first time we thought we had a great st and then everyone stood up and we couldn't see the effects on the castle door, so second time we got closer to the front just over the half way point of the roundabout in front of the castle and everyone remained sat down which made it better viewing for all especially the little one. Queue times for rides not to bad, considering it was still school holidays, but there was a big difference once the French had gone back to school on the Wednesday and queues got even shorter. Fast pass is avaiable on some popular rides but we never used them and the longest queued was about half an hour! Peter pans flight and ratatouille where the most popular, ratatouille not to be missed awesome ride!!Loved our trip and would return again, definitely needed the three days we had in parks as we did all shows, all rides, all parades and didn't feel that we had to rush.","Disneyland_Paris"

We paid, a rather substantial sum, to have the company of a Disney Cast member for 5 hours who was able to get us, a group of 10, on to the rides via either the FastPass queues or via the exit. We weren't able to do this for all the rides and shows but most of the ones that had big queues so we were able to go on all the rides, in both parks, we wanted to even though we were only there for the weekend.

There are two parks,disneyland park & walt disneyland studio. Better to get aquinted with them on the website before u decide whether to visit both or one of them.Since we went in off season,though the crowd didn't make me feel so, we got heavy discount on the entry fee.Also, its not practically possible to cover all the rides in one day, so select your favourites from the brochure that you will get. Some which I really liked were  Indiana Jones    and the Temple of Peril,Pirates of Carribean,big thunder mountain,space mountain mission2,star tours,its a small world,Sleeping Beauty Castle. But it all depends whom are you going with, kids will like fantasyland more.Watch out for the parades, they will announce it... it wonderful to see the characters u grew with in person!! when in disneyland always keep your camera ready.The visit to walt disney park gives an insight into the magical world of special effects & the labor that goes into the making of animation.Armageddon Special Effects,Studio tram tour, they are all so thrilling..For kids, stitch live is a must! My suggestion would be to go to both the parks, how often will u visit disneyland paris!! Do buy some souvinier from the park shop for lovely memory. Watch out for the weather though, it rained in evening when we went & it spoilt the fun. Overall, a good family & frenz dayout..","Disneyland_Paris"

An utterly shameless, unapologetic exercise in parting us idiot parents from our very hard earned in order to keep aged Disney executives in seven figure pensions. An awful, soulless dump where smiling faces are almost as hard to find among the punters as the underpaid, undertrained, over stressed staff. Ludicrous queues for everything, including the ghastly food (80 Euros for a foul buffet for three with three soft drinks, all of which we had to choose and pay for before being allowed to sit  and I gave up another lunch in Paris for this?) on what was allegedly a quiet ish day. Epitomises everything that is wrong with Western consumer society (and from a card carrying red in tooth and claw libertarian free marketeer, that really is saying something).You really want to do something for your kids? Take 'em fishing: read to 'em: if you're close by in, oh, I dunno, Paris, take them for a proper lunch followed by an hour in Notre Dame (where the faithful will still be worshipping when this hole is a landfill......covered by a majestic ancient forest). DON'T BRING THEM HERE.","Disneyland_Paris"

However, it is very small and the no smoking policy is never enforced (smokers are EVERYWHERE   even in the queues); security and cast members just walk right past. We went in September and rode everything in one day. There was one parade and one fireworks show   no other shows were on the schedule. We never saw any photo pass people, so I'm not sure what good having a photo pass would be. ","Disneyland_Paris"

From the outside it looks like separate shops, but it's just one big store. There are some items that are only found at the respective 'land' e.g. Mystic Point memorabilia, wider selection of Princess dresses at Fantasyland. If you are looking for hats mickey ears, go to the Main Street store, the biggest selection is there.  park food is expensive. I was able to enter with some snacks and drinking water. They have these 3 in 1 meal coupons that might help you save a bit although they are only usable at selected restaurants.  HALAL FOOD IS NOW AVAILABLE! Tahitian Terrace is cheap ( HK$100 per set) but not so tasty, IMO. Also, they do not have kids' sets. The food at Explorers' Club at Mystic Point is SOOOOO MUCCCHHH YUMMIIIEERRR and they have kids' meals available! (about HK$120). Plenty of seating available there as well.  Mystic Manor is one of the best amusement park rides we've been on...truly amazing. Don't miss it!   Fastpass Winnie the Pooh at Fantasyland and go on the other rides first.  If you want to get really close to fireworks, be prepared to come early to camp out in front of the castle. We were there 30 mins before the fireworks began and already there were hordes of people seated there already.  Parents, don't let your kids stop you from taking the rides! You can arrange for a rider swap up front (parents take turns to ride, not so fun, but at least you get to take it) Don't miss out on Space Mountain and Grizzly Gulch!  Stitch Encounter was also enjoyable. Check with the cast members on show timings for English Cantonese Mandarin versions.  Princesses appear at the gazebo outside Fantasyland. They're so charming :) if you're lucky, your little princess might be given a 'Star Princess' sticker that will allow them to participate in the 'Flights of Fantasy parade. Star Princesses are also given front row seating at the parade.   comfy shoes and sunblock is a must. It's winter but the sun is still quite strong!  drinking fountains are available outside the toilets, save a few bucks on water that way.  coffee is near daylight robbery. HK$22 for a 3 in 1 Nescafe!  In my review two years ago, I mentioned about the boorish Chinese tourists...that hasn't changed at all. My children and I were nearly bulldozed by a group of senior citizens, who for some reason really wanted to get in front of us at the queue for the Orbitron. They push, nudge and when you don't budge, they just push even harder. It's ok if you weigh 250 lbs like my husband but not OK when you are with small kids. It's awful and really put a dampener on my vacation. Be careful at attractions like the Golden Mickeys, Lion King Festival, Philharmonic, even Mystic Manor because they will do whatever it takes to get a seat first (EVEN IF THERE ARE STILL A GAZILLION SEATS LEFT!!!). I've been to amusement parks in Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and the US and this is the only place where I've seen such things happen. Now there are constant reminders to park visitors to not cut queues and not 'pre booking' places in line for a large party. The park tries their best to manage the queues, but you can't do much if people are just  like that .","Disneyland_HongKong"

457037821,4,"2017-1","United States","I went to Disneyland last weekend with my friends. I bought a ticket for $105 at the ticket office in front of Disneyland. I recommend that you buy a ticket online in advance because it will be cheaper than the ticket office where I bought mine. I entered Disneyland Park around 9:30 a.m. The park opens at 8 a.m. and there were already a lot of people. I recommend you download a Disneyland app which has all of Disneyland   s information, including wait times for attractions and locations of the Disney characters. Disneyland Park is divided into 6 big areas, like Tomorrowland and Fantasyland. First, I went to Tomorrowland and picked up a fastpass ticket for Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain. It was so exciting and speedy, and I really wanted to ride it again but I gave up because of the long line. I went on only 5 rides because they were so crowded and had long lines. At night, there was a parade at 8:30 p.m. and fireworks at 9:25 p.m. They were so beautiful and splendid. I highly recommend going to Disneyland.","Disneyland_California"
18941182,5,"missing","United States","I went back to Disneyland for the third time in my life this past spring. The last two trips to DL was somewhere in the early to mid 90s when I was in elementary school. Back then, Anaheim looked sooo different. It didn't look as developed as it does today.Downtown Disney, Disney Symphony Hall, resort hotels, parking garages, etc. I was completey taken back by everything. I still have memories of the Disneyland Hotel sitting next to the parking lot shared by Disneyland itself. All the other hotels were situated across from Disneyland. Also, the gondola ride that went through the mountain. I remember feeling a bit sad that the gondola was taken down when I went back to Disneyland for the second time. If anyone's been to Disney World as many times as I have in my life and never been to Disneyland before, expect to find a different kind of Disney. Sure, they share many of the same attractions, but they also have differences too. Such as Toon Town which you can only find in Disneyland which is not like Mickey's Toontown Fair in the Magic Kingdom. You won't find a hidden shop in Sleeping Beauty's Castle. You'll definitely not see a familiar huge four leg machine hovering over you in the Star Tours line.Disneyland is smaller compared to its Florida counterpart but it is the original. Literally, Walt's brainchild. The first Haunted Mansion in the world. The first Pirates of the Caribbean in the world (with an extra drop). To me, the place gives me a local flavor compared to whenever I'm in Florida. You won't find an EPCOT, but you'll find a lot of different attractions taken from all four WDW parks combined into two different parks. Also, I feel that while Disney World's Downtown Disney has a very interesting layout around a lake, I find Disneylands DD to be very pretty with a lot of small fountains that light up at night. Tips to all Disney newbies:1) It's best to go to any Disney park during the off season (which is basically fall and spring). Less lines. Less waiting time. 2) Plan out your visit responsibly and economically. Try not to think that you have to see everything or go see everything at once. 3) If you want to see almost everything with less wait time, get to the park early. Meaning, right before the park opens! I was surprised, for an off season time, to see a long line for the Nemo ride (which I never got on) in the afternoon. 4) Eating in the park is nice but it's obviously more expensive to eat in than out. Unlike WDW where Downtown Disney is pretty far off from any park, Disneyland is conveniently connected with Downtown Disney. You can easily stamp your hand before exiting the park just to go to DD to eat and come back. I never tried this at DL since I came in after eating lunch in DD. Then, ate a churro for dinner. (Note: The turkey legs sell out fast before a night show. Get 'em while they're still there!) 5) Make sure your family is stocked with either cell phones or walkie talkies. Helps keep everyone stay connected. Wear matching clothing like the same colored shirt helps too.6) If you're in a large group and want to seperate into smaller groups, make a meeting spot for everyone. In example: the obvious meeting point for a lot of people would be Sleeping Beauty's Castle since it's in the center. 7) For any night parade and show, this is also a golden rule. To get a secured good spot, get to the event early or else, you'll be seeing the top of people's heads for most of the show. If you do end up at the back of the audience, it's best to bring a camcorder to be your eyes. ^ ^ 8) If you want a good rate at a good hotel, do not stay in a Disney resort hotel. Simple as that. Sure, the service may not be as  high quality  as the one you'd find in a Disney hotel, but that doesn't mean the hotel itself is bad. You just won't find the Disneyess in the hotel. If you have enough money to spend and want that extra resort amenity such as a Disney themed pool, then by all means, book a reservation. 9) Parking at Downtown Disney is free for the first 3 hours. That would be the only downside to not staying at a Disney hotel. Three hours is usually enough though unless you park in Disneyland's garage giving you unlimited parking until the last tram leaves Downtown Disney which varies in time. 10) Have fun! Not every Disney trip is a happy one for some people due to certain circumstances so it's best to be level headed about any situation.","Disneyland_California"

The fast track system is good to use. The staff were very kind and thoughtful, the system in place to ensure a smooth ride was really outstanding. At each ride we were asked how many and they accommodated this fact in all rides. We knew that thunder mountain would be closed, this was explained at the time of booking. However, not the carousel and another ride which was closed were we not informed about. But luckily the carousel ride did open before we left. A couple of rides had technical difficulties while we were there but again.....it happens.

Having been to the Disney parks in Florida and California, this one seemed smaller, yet there are lots to do and see. The free park maps available make it easy to find your way around and plan your day.The Walt Disney Studios are smaller than the Disneyland Park and there are fewer attractions, yet the fee to see them is the same. Disneyland was beautifully decorated with the yellow colors of Fall. Going on a weekday in October, the queues were not long and we were able to see all major attractions. Highlights: Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones, the Aerosmith Ride. Space Mountain is also a thrill, but the constant bumping of your head against the headrest makes it less enjoyable. We didn't have this problem on the Aerosmith ride. Food is expensive, about 15 euros for a burger with fries, but tasty. Service is slow, even in the fast foods. Bathrooms were relatively clean, yet smelly. The Disney Dreams show is absolutely fantastic. It is amazing what they can do with a few colored lights and some fireworks.

The actual parks aren   t as big as I had expected, and more of the bigger rides are in Disney California Adventure. The parade and the firework show are well worth seeing, but the light show on the evening wasn   t as good, and could probably be missed out if you are tight on time.

I visited the park 4 times, when it first opened, and an average of every 2 years after that and I admit that there has always been a magical, indescribably Disney speckle, but Hong Kong Disneyland is not that special when compared with the other Disney parks. Space mountain is always a hit, Toy Story land is cute, and Main Street USA is always quaint, but I find it very problematic how Disney did not exploit its chances with incorporating Hong Kong's flare into its characters attractions. It is quite cute when Minnie Mouse dresses up in traditional qipao and also a nice surprise when the space cafe serves cha siu burgers but these feel so obvious...Tourists and happy little kids are everywhere, they make you feel like a big kid at heart but, you are better off going to Ocean Park where there are more attractions and specifically, ones that are more specific to local culture, natural site and history.

Characters don't wander around the parks, you usually have to queue to meet them (we had two every morning at Hotel Cheyenne for photo opportunities and autograph signing!). We didn't meet the Princesses (Princess Pavilion)   queue was 2 hours long (no Fast Passes for this one) and you couldn't choose your princess so wasn't worth it.

The 2 extra magic hours are good for kids if you are staying at one of the disney properties.It makes sense to reserve your lunch dinner tables as that will save you from queuing again.For the 7pm Parade as well as the Disney dreams show at 11pm, you have to get there an hour earlier at least if you want to get good spots.Buying your daughter a princess dress out of the park will save you atleast 40 euros, unfortunately for us we had no choice, and had to shell out 60 euros for one, But the look on their faces when they wear it is priceless.The overall experience was good except for the 2nd hand smoke.","Disneyland_Paris"

We went on May 1, a Monday. The park was very busy and we somehow managed to stay ahead of the crowd. We arrived right at opening and stayed until 8 PM. I did thorough research before going and really studied the Fast Pass system. We rode Hyperspace Mountain first, followed by Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters. Both lines were 20 minutes. We then rode the Matterhorn Bobsleds, the wait was 40 minutes. After that we pulled a Fast Pass for Space Mountain. The return time was 4:30, we pulled the pass at 12:30, so at 2:30 we could get another fast pass. You can get another fast pass every 2 hours even if you hold a pass already, again, do your research!! We rode many rides that day, pirates twice, Matterhorn twice and space Mountain twice, Big Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain, Alice In Wonderland, Monorail, Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise. It was a great day, probably easier because our daughter is a young teen who doesn't need to ride all the rides in Fantasyland. I can see it being more difficult with young children. Thanks Disneyland for giving us a great day.","Disneyland_California"

Get a map for everyone and plot your activities; take note of the schedule of the live shows. Here's what we did. Go board first the Grand Circle Tour to avoid the queues. Immerse in this magical 3 D adventure at Philhar Magic. It's a 15 mins. show; prepare to get wet (well, sort of). Go to Golden Mickey's and see live your favorite cartoon characters presented in the style of an awards ceremony. Then, take a journey on the  happiest cruise that ever sailed . Board the Jungle River Cruise next and see Tarzan's treehouse and the angry gods of the mountains. Take your lunch at the Comet Cafe. Stroll around and check some stuffs in souvenir shops nearby. Then head to the Festival of the Lion King (this is our favorite). It's a colorful pageantry of dance and music of our favorite movie, the great Lion King! Spend the rest of your afternoon (while waiting for the parade and the fireworks) with some thrilling rides (Space Mountain) and make your cameras very busy this time with everything you see. Try this storybook journey to the Hundred Acre Wood. Shop at Main Street, USA.It rained momentarily (but heavily) when the parade started.

Before I came here, my friends said that this disneyland is small compared to other disneyland. But I think that there is a lot to do and I did not cover even half of it in the whole day I was there.As soon as I entered the park, I saw the train ride. It takes you from one station to the other. I did not do any rides as there were lots of big queues for them. I thought that the shows here are what sets disneyland apart from other theme parks, so I aimed at watching as many shows as possible. If you had time to watch two shows then watch the Lion King show and Mickey's wonderous story (they are both musicals). They are a sight to behold. There is also a parade at 3.30pm and another at 7.30pm. Both are definitely worth seeing. The magical day ended with a fireworks show outside the castle at 9pm.The people are very helpful in Disneyland and if you need help they will go the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable. Before entering the park you have to go through a security check where they make sure you are not carrying any food with you. They prefer you eat their overpriced and greasy food inside the park. There are a lot of greasy and sugary options in there. Not a lot of healthy options and basically no vegetarian options other than potato chips. While they have done well with the shows and customer service, they have a long way to go in terms of food.","Disneyland_HongKong"

I have one major positive for the attraction ... they allow you get a fast pass every 2 or 3 hours which was fantastic and you could plan your day around that. For me this was just brilliant. I feel that it is wrong to ask parents to buy fast passes having spent money into the park ... the way they do it here is much better.  Add the cost into the ticket if you have to  The two negatives  one just time of the year  ... on Hallowean night to kick everyone out at 8pm and charge for re entry is just wrong.The second negative is far more important. We spent 5 days at the resort and the choice of food was so poor. A lot of restaurants are booked out and all the remaining food in the park is over priced fast food ... burgers   chips   soft drinks etc .., in todays world I really think that if they put some serious locations where healthy food choices were available ...

581531996,5,"2018-5","United States","The original and still the best....Don't arrive with unrealistic expectations. After many visits to the Parks, I have learned that you have to enjoy your family and friends time.... do not expect to move easily from one ride to another without a wait or at least expect some delays. DO NOT try to ride and see everything, you will only become frustrated and disappointed. Pick and choose which rides that you want to go on and which shows or parades that you want to see.Plan your days... know the schedule of your shows, rides and parades. Get the fastpass for your rides early if your schedule allows, but do not be so regimented that you do not adjust your schedule if necessary.You may need to reserve a spot for your parades or shows (maybe with a blanket, shirt, backpack or shopping bag ) and sit there and wait, if possible.Ask cast members for suggestions on better seating and the best points of view, they are there to help you.... and plan on spending several days to enjoy the parks with a multi day Park Hopper.Enjoy your time in the park.

185126658,4,"2013-11","United Kingdom","Firstly the hotel and parks.Stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne, basic hotel but the only time your see it is when it's time for sleep.Parks   well it's Disney, it was Christmas time and all the magic was there, from the parades to Main Street when the wind blows through it, the decorations move and it starts snowing, it's a odd thing to see people just stopping and working out what's going on.Staying in the hotel grants you two extra hours in the morning before it official opens to the public but all your get is a few rides and photo opportunities in an empty park.Now the main part   how expensive is it?Best take a lot of money with you just for food & drink if you want to use the restaurants.Once you are there you don't have much choice where to eat, but here's a few tips.Hotel Cheyenne charges nearly   5.95 a pint of beer (based on 1.15 Euro), so does most of the restaurants in Downtown Disney. Restaurants there start from   20 for a meal not including drinks, the steakhouse is just under   30. The hotels will offer a buffet breakfast and you will witness guests not bothering with plates but just loading up trays (I mean more than one) of bread rolls, butter and ham to take to the park, not leaving a lot for anyone else.If you want a beer visit King Ludwig's in DTD as between 5:00 and 7:30 they offer half price drinks,   3.05 a pint or a 4 pint glass for   8.50.McDonalds do a meal deal plus nuggets with a beer for   8 and is the only place in Disney that has free wi fi (do the express ordering on the consoles near the door or expect a long wait)Earl of Sandwich offer good subway type 6  with soup for   8.80Sports Bar offers a hotdog & fries for   8.85, don't know what it was like as no one was bothered to take the order.If you are staying in the park hotels, walk through DTD towards the train station, exit the park and go through the doors at the train station and head left towards a shop called Relay   beer is   2, sandwiches for   3.40 and bottles of coke from   1.60 or pay   3.40 in Disney. Come out head right and your back in the park.Well worth the visit but probably not again for a while as there's one new ride next year (Ratatouille) then nothing until around 2020.Hope this helps you save a little money.","Disneyland_Paris"

345612197,4,"2016-1","Canada","Disneyland has hit critical mass   there aren't any slow times anymore. The last week in January was very busy with long line ups, and this was Tuesday through Thursday. If you go during a time when children are in school then expect an ocean of strollers (with very young babies), pre schoolers, and on the other side of the demographic spectrum, volumes of adults and seniors. The three teenage boys in my group managed to have a blast regardless   they found ways to circumnavigate the crowd and enjoyed Big Thunder and Splash Mountain at park opening times as the masses of people typically head towards FantasyLand and TomorrowLand. Peter Pan Flight line ups were 45 minutes within the park's opening. The whole park is going Stars Wars   it was disappointing that the delightful DL train was down as was some of the waterfront area including the Tom Sawyer Island Pirate's Lair and Fantasmic. Small World was also being refurbished, as was Autopia and the iconic Jungle Cruise. In California Land, at least two of the big draws were shut down: World of Color and Soaring Over California. In addition, the Aladdin show had already ended its run. During our visit, several of the key rides seemed to suffer technical difficulties and hence were shut down for portions of the day. The night parade is gorgeous   but hard to see if one doesn't save a seat for three hours on the pavement. We tried to watch it from the Plaza Inn where we had dinner   but the view was limited. All in all one must determine if the price of admission is worth it   DL tickets go up every year   there are so many locals attending that there isn't a downtime anymore. The overall design and visuals are stunning   the gift stores and restaurants are overpriced but part of the experience. Staff tries very hard to please. If DL is a vacation destination then do your homework, budget accordingly, and be prepared to wait in long line ups; but if you plan wisely, you and your group will have a magical experience. If you are lucky, like my group was, a very nice family may even offer you their unused fast passes.","Disneyland_California"

You have to have your wits about you when queueing as we witnessed queue jumpers five times. No one got past me however but my children were scared not to let them past so I had to act like bouncer!

I had visited Disneyland in Orlando, USA many years ago and I think that I liked it better than Eurodisney. However if you live in Europe, choosing Eurodisney is an one way decision. Children at the age of 10 want to prove that they are not babys, so we visited almost nothing else but the  dangerous  games (Space Mountain, BigThunder Mountain, Indiana Jones etc) again and again and again. They found thw quiet ones  boring and not interesting , so it might be a good idea to take them for a visit at the age between 6 and 9. The 2  extra magic  hours (8 10 a.m.) offered to those who stay at the Parks' hotels is not really much, because not all the lands are open (only Fantasyland and Discoveryland) and then again in those 2 lands not all the attractions are open (only certain games, such as Caroussel, Mad Hatter's Tea Cups, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Orbitron etc, but not the popular Autopia or Pinocchio or Blanche Neige). We met a lot of Disney characters through the park and the children were really excited and very happy. We went there in December (1st week), so it was not crowded and the waiting lines were very short. It was however freezing cold and getting dark was very early (around 5 o'clock). The park closed at 7 p.m., so you have less time than visiting in summer (where the park is open until 11 p.m.) but due to the cold you can anyway not stand to stay any longer. Don't miss the Parade and the Dream Show at closing time. Simply spectacular!!!!!","Disneyland_Paris"

We hopped on a train from Gare Du Nord which took approximately 40 minutes. We decided we wanted entrance to the main park and Universal Studios which was 75E each! Pretty good really :) (you can get it cheaper if you book in advance online and they send you the ticket). The cashier told us that the Universal Studios closed at 7.30pm so we had plenty of time to see and do everything. First I'll start with the main park....There are 3 sections... we spent most of our time in one section, going on all of the rides and eating in a nice cafe, etc. There are some good (and some scary :) ) rides there.. (it is the left section on the map). The Haunted House was good and so were the rides next to it (cant remember the names, sorry   one looks like a volcano, that was a scary ride haha).There was a show in the centre, by the pink princess castle, which was quite good :) it was the evil characters in the shows. Then we went to Universal Studios and went on the rides there... they were awesome! We went on the Hollywood Tower (took me a lot of pursuading my boyfriend to come on that with me lol) which is like a lift that goes crazy, dropping and all   this took over an hour to queue for but well worth it :) We also went on Space Mountain   this was AWESOME!!!! Highly recommended! So fun and didnt have to queue as it was about to close!We went on some of the other rides here too which were fab, but cant remember names, sorry. We also went on the tour... this is a cart thing that takes you round a 'Hollywood set'   so realistic. And they do some special effects aswell. This was incredible!

We were able to ride almost everything. I would never ever recommend someone go to Disneyland without a plan set out. We saw only 2 characters during our 14 hour visit. They clearly do not have any kind of crowd control going on because it was busier there than Disney World at Christmas! The employees are not as friendly as the cast members at Disney World. In fact a few times they were just downright rude. As we got our hands stamped to leave an employees said to my son,  Hey KID, its THIS WAY!  and thats just not what you get at Disney World. The cast members there (disney world) are taught to treat customers with respect even if they are small. It was not magical and it was way over crowded. You'd think that for as much as they charge to get in, they could manage the crowds a little better. If you hate crowds you will definitely want to skip Disneyland. We were at the front of the line at rope drop and we went straight to Peter Pan's flight and the line was already wrapped around the building. It was total Chaos there. During the parades you are shoulder to shoulder. Once you've been to Disney World, Disneyland is just one big let down. We got to the fireworks an hour early and had to sit almost all the way to the buildings on main street and then we walked straight to fantasmic and there was no seating left. The employee we encountered there was also rude. If you want the experience of Disney but can't make it to Disney World then by all means go just make sure you go EARLY and have a plan (I suggest ridemax). If you want a truly magical experience, skip it and fly to Orlando instead. I am glad we got to mark it off our bucket list but we will not go back.","Disneyland_California"

The park did handle the numbers well however it does make the whole experience more stressful, especially when you don't expect it.The park itself is a blend of the classic Disney rides from Alice in Wonderland through to Buzz Lightyears's Astro Blasters set into well laid out zones which are all very distinctive. There are a good range of restaurants both sit down and counter service however I would definitely make a reservation if you're looking at one of the waiter service restaurants. I was disappointed in the gift shops as there wasn't really anything special that was different  I thought especially with it being the original Disney park, they would make more of that rather than standard gift shop fare you can find in Paris or Hong Kong.I think ultimately for me, Disney will always give you a day out that's different and special however I think this park has lost its way a little bit and for that reason I would probably head to Knott's Berry Farm instead for my next visit.","Disneyland_California"

With the same money I've paid per person, I could've added another 5 star restaurant in the city to enjoy.","Disneyland_Paris"

It is very much like California's parks, easy enough to walk around without getting too tired but still with good spaces between areas. There is a  pirate boat  type ride, based on the car from toy story, a 'run away' train and space mountain for the orders kids, but I still love Buzz Lightyear! Some shows have different times for different languages. For the Disney Pin collectors, yes, they do swaps here too! The castle was a lot smaller, but the fireworks magnificent! Tickets can be purchased on line, with some travel agents offering small discounts. Then there are at booths to swap internet tickets to full tickets before you go in. It is also possible to come out of the park to go via MTR to the outlets mall and then come back should you want. Don't forget the umbrella for shade, and we weren't stopped taking water in (there are some water stations around, but not many).

I still enjoyed it a lot, but there are things that happened this time that I just don't know if it's worth it anymore. We looked at several sights and came to the conclusion Early Oct is a great time to visit. Nice weather and not to buys. We looked at what rides were closed and decided to go and take the kids out of school. It was busy. very busy. If this is considered not busy    then my point is made for me. Long lines. Long waits. I think it has to do with so so many season passes. Almost everyone paying for meals and merchandise had a season pass card to get their discount. I understand economics. Disney just doesn't care about the experience as long as they are full. But for me, I just don't think we can do it anymore and fight with the wall to wall traffic. On top of that we made sure that splash mountain was suppose to be open .. then on day 3    we go over to that area    big sign up the area is closed. So we ask the person standing there    for how long? A month!!! We were not the only people complaining. On top of that I have never in my other 7 times experienced the high level of break downs!! Thunder mountain many times. Space mountain also. Even some of the smaller rides like Snow white was down for periods of time. With all the extra season pass money you think they could pay for some maintenance so things would stay up. A once great place is now just run to maximize profits. The experience is secondary as long as people show up. Walt .. we need you back. This place has lost it's way.","Disneyland_California"

It was considerably smaller than Disney World, but still tons of things to do. We were able to go on all the rides and visit both Disneyland Paris and Walt Disney Studios Park (which was walking distance next door). I would definitely recommend getting to the park early. If coming from the city of Paris, check the RER times. I believe it was RER C line and it left every 30 minutes...The doors opened early for the extra park hours for the Disney resort guests. We were able to enter the park early with them and visit the shops and then once the park officially opened we were already inside. We did the main rides at Disneyland first in the morning, ate lunch, and then went to Walt Disney Studios. We then walked to the Disney Village area and shopped for a bit. We then went back to the DIsneyland park in the late afternoon and stayed at Disneyland Paris where we went on the other rides that weren't as important to us and then watched the firework show which is a must see!","Disneyland_Paris"

The shops were no more expensive than the Disney shops in local towns but with a vast more variety ( there is a MASSIVE shop just outside the park by the cinema that sells everything so I would go there rather than carry things around the park as its exactly the same merchandise ) .Transfers to the hotel and park were very regular and easy to find .The Two parks are enormous , we went to the studio park about 7 at night and a lot was closed so I would suggest a few days to go as we never saw all of the other park either . The staff mostly all spoke the basics of English but I did find I felt rather rude as to not know the basics of French and so my husband and I along with the children are learning some of the language before 2017 for our week long trip there.I found the park , eating areas , toilets etc.to be very high in the cleanliness standard , lots of staff cleaning and nothing was ever a problem if we asked for any information . overall a fantastic trip away and thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would highly recommend it xxx","Disneyland_Paris"

Not sure about other European countries but an annual pass costs about the same as buying a two day pass in the UK. Couple of block out dates but look it up online. Disneyland this year on the days we went had stuff broken for hours. Thunder Mountain was off for an entire afternoon, space mission was off for the same arvo and the entire following morning. Some of the Fast Passes weren't working. OK kids, this is the trick... Check dates for block out but get a Fantasy annual pass. You can get in at 8am not 10am.

The Sunday the weather had turned and was wet all day, but as a result we were straight on to EVERY ride and by 6pm it felt like we had the park almost all to ourselves.Certainly worth a visit and the look on my 3 year old daughters face made it worth it..... but if taking someone so young be ready for a number of fits and tantrums throughout the day (first day our daughter did not want to nap during the day and with the heat she was VERY grumpy by dinner time...but nest day she napped for about 2 hours in her buggy and for the rest of the day was as good as gold).Well worth doing if you do not fancy a transatlantic flight to the Orlando Parks, but if you get lucky with the weather you get just as great day.Food is a lot to be desired for (two days on rather poor burgers left me feeling uncomfortable.... so best to bring your own stuff as the money does seem to go in no time on small things throughout the day).","Disneyland_Paris"

Disneyland Hong Kong has inherited that trait, and it is small. But for it's size, it does offer as much of the magic from Disneyland that it can fit. The parade's are done quite nicely, and almost every area of the park is used up to entertain it's visitors. Most of the rides are always in working order (as opposed to Disneyland Paris) and though shorter than what is offered in the States, it's quite entertaining. I was extremely pleased with the Disney in the Stars fireworks display. In fact, it's so nicely done that Disney HK actually offers fireworks only entry tickets for certain local tours.The bottom line is, if you expected a Disneyland experience like the one in the US, you would be quite disappointed. But for people in Asia who has never been to a Disneyland or can't afford to go all the way to the States, this would probably be as close as you can get to an international Disneyland experience (Tokyo Disneyland is setup to cater to Japanese speaking people so I would hardly call it international).","Disneyland_HongKong"

I went in March got there at opening (10am) and up until approx. 3pm was pleasantly surprised at the crowds. I didn't have to wait very long at all for anything however once in the late afternoon everyone seemed to show up then and the ques grew to 'disneyland' standard.

332795875,2,"2015-8","Oman","This was my first visit to HK Disneyland. I have previously been to all other Disney parks (Florida, California, Paris, Tokyo) at least 2 times each park. So I know a little bit about Disney parks.My daughter and I visited HK Disneyland in August 2015. The weather was warm and waiting for rides was an uncomfortable experience. For example, the waiting area for the Jungle River Cruise was a shaded area that only had 2 fans. With many people waiting for their turn for the ride, the air was very stall and it was uncomfortable even to breath normally while waiting for the ride. We went in the English language Jungle River Cruise. I have been to this ride in other Disney parks previously. This ride is normally very entertaining and the comments by the guide are generally funny. Not in HK Disneyland. The guide was not using a PA system and it was difficult to hear him clearly. What I was able to hear of his commentary was not funny or entertaining at all. (Yes, his English accent was also very bad).The park is small compared to other Disney parks, and has limited rides. Many of the rides were the merry go round type of rides e.g. Dumbo, Orbitron, Cinderella Carousel, tea Cups, Slinky Dog Spin. These rides may have been fun 50 years ago, but they do not appeal too much to the younger generation these days. Disney needs to come up with new ideas for their rides.The light parade at night is normally one of the highlights of Disney parks. Not in HK Disneyland. The parade only had a limited number of floats and was over in around 15 minutes.The fireworks display at near the closing time is also normally a highlight of Disney parks. Not in HK Disneyland. The fireworks here were basic type and only lasted a few minutes.As in other Disney parks, food and beverages in HK Disneyland were overpriced.Another negative point here is that many people did not want to queue up in waiting lines and they would jump the lines. This would happen while the Disney park attendants were around. The attendants never intervened to stop people from jumping the lines. RUDE.Overall, our experience was not a good one at all. If you have been to other Disney parks, please skip this one. If this is going to be your only Disney experience, please be ready for limited rides, bad management of park facilities and people jumping the queuing lines while park attendants not enforcing any disciple. One last word to Disney Management; your REALLY need to come up with new ideas for new rides and attractions if you want to retain you park visitors.","Disneyland_HongKong"

The appearance is very shabby, dirty and everyone was smoking which surprised me. The park is way smaller yet more expensive and the park didn't open til 10am! Disney in Anaheim opened at 7am. A lot of rides were closed and it was height of summer. Very disappointing. The food inside the park was generic and over priced as well. Staff were not 'disneylike' and hardly spoke regardless of what language. I can converse in three languages yet none of the staff could give a hoot. Just basically ignored people. Even in most shops there were four or five cash registers yet only one open at a time and a line formed for a massive wait time just to purchase a toy. Very slack work ethic. Hardly any characters around either for the little kids. In four days I saw Pinocchio, eeyore, and lilo and stich. That's it! In Usa, the characters are in every land all the time, the place is clean, and the staff magical to combine a magical experience. In Paris, it's nothing more than dirty expensive playground where you line up for hours and then the ride may break, like the Big Thunder Rail ride did for us. Won't be returning here.

No lines to buy tickets to get into the park and super quick to walk over to the rides. We were there on a Thursday in January and we didn   t have any lines longer than 5 minutes until around noon. We also got a fast pass for Hyper Space Mountain in the morning to be sure we could come back again later without waiting. I would also recommend downloading the Hong Kong Disneyland app to see wait times and get a map of the park. We ate at the Main Street Corner cafe and the sweet and sour chicken and shrimp and the burgers were really good. It was easy to get here with the MTR and it took us about 35 minutes to arrive from Kowloon. I don   t think I would come here a second time, but definitely worth a visit at least one time.

It was our fifth visit to the park and it's going to be our last, the only magic you have now is how much money they try to squeeze out of you which wouldn't be such a bother if the entrance fee wasn't 100     per day.It looks all dated and in need of refurbishment which also takes a lot magic away. We were there over the weekend in januari so not the busiest time of the year but waiting times for the popular attractions were well over a hour with a peak of 180minutes for ratatouille. Instead of doing something about it Disney decided to make special fastpasses called super and ultimate fastpasses ofcourse against a hefty price starting from 30    day for 3 attraction (so 10    attraction) to 150    per day per person for all attractions.We ate at the Agrabah Caf  , for the 3rd time and my god has the quality gone down. Seems like budget cuts everywhere but prices go up. With still an hour to go into the service they weren't happy to keep the buffet stocked. Food itself was barely warm.In general the staff doesn't seem happy anymore to work for Disney and do the bare minimum which results in long waiting lines and waiting times. Organisation is not what it should be and that's the fault of managment. I can imaging if you are a first time visitor you are still impressed enough to miss such things but we can compare it to how it was 10 years ago and it has gone downhill and it's going downhill faster.

We had a great guide on the Jungle Cruise and he had us in stitches. Soaring over California needs to be updated, but we still road twice.The only negative during our whole trip was the nasty cast member who kept telling us to move along when my kids were watching the parade, she was downright rude and abrasive.

Felt sorry for person in front of us. They are awful and make your day start out great (sarcasm). Now finally in get to deal with long lines, high prices, strollers slammed into you all day long. They do not even shade the lines or have spray water like Universal Studios, Knotts or Magic Mountain to name a few. Of course for their workers they do but forget their guests. Rudest people ever and to top off when we returned to car our hubcap was stolen. Of course not their fault so $20 gets you nothing as no security or anyone trying to help or make your visit enjoyable. Awful place now so save your money!!","Disneyland_California"

Sometimes height can be an issue at theme parks but not in Hong Kong!Sunday and Monday were good days to visit, with Monday being busier which surprised us. Queues were in the range of 5mins (walk straight on) to up to an hour for the main rides on Monday. We managed to time visits to minimize wait times. The only downside was the extortionate prices for food and water. Given the captive audience I understand they need to turn a profit but if you can I suggest you bring your own. Options are limited and I'm still in shock at paying the asking prices. If we had been able to keep the family fed and watered at more reasonable rates then Disney HK would have been a solid 5 stars. Everything else was fantastic. The parades and fireworks were spectacular and the Lion King a must see! Incredibly professional and well run park. 1 day probably isn't enough to enjoy everything and 3 days is too much. 2 days worked perfectly for us.","Disneyland_HongKong"

530935927,5,"2017-9","United States","I hadn't been to Disneyland in many years, but on this revisit I would still agree with my past assessment my heart still loves this place much more than Walt Disney World! Disneyland is less crowded (though yes, the park can get a ton of people on any given day it's still way less crowded than WDW), the weather is generally better at Disneyland, the food is better, and the rides are much closer together (I hate having to go to 4 different parks at WDW to experience the rides I love in just 1 park at Disneyland Resort). The cast members also make this place a winner. I spoke with many different Disneyland employees while trying pin trading for the first time and they were all lovely. Pin trading is a lot of fun too but I will let you know that pin trading has decreased a lot in the parks from what I understand it used to be like in years past. Most of the pin trading has been relegated to a single pin board in each of the shops (or at least a lot of the shops)...you may find a pin cart with a pin board available to perused or a random cast member wearing a lanyard, but don't expect to see pin trading all over the park anymore.Most of the food locations in the park are very good. I ate at the Blue Bayou and at the Carthay Circle...but found my favorite places were actually lower priced locations. I suggest you stick to Rancho del Zocalo and The Red Rose Tavern they were my absolute favorites! At Rancho del Zocalo I would highly recommend the taco salad and at The Red Rose Tavern any sandwich with a side of the pommes frites those things are AMAZING! Those meals with a large drink will run you around $17 $20. Oh, and at Rancho del Zocalo you can get free soda refills!!!!! Both places have great portions and a much better price margin than most anything else in the park.As for the rides, they are all just as good as I remember them to be. Fun, light hearted, and thoroughly enjoyable. At Disneyland you are just a hop, skip, and a jump away from the next ride too...so much better than WDW, lol. You can go from ride to ride and have a fun filled day of dozens and dozens of different rides ridden. And on rare occasions you might even be invited to do something cool, like I was fortunate enough to get to do on one night of my trip. My dad and I were riding on the monorail late one evening and the conductor Sam asked us if we would like to ride in the front of the monorail with her while she drove. We not only got to ride in the front but she also let us take pictures in the driver's seat once we were back at the station! And it's things like this that keep Disneyland as the clear winner of my heart over Walt Disney World any day!","Disneyland_California"

281062159,5,"2015-5","Australia","This was the 3rd time that I've visited Disneyland. Every time Ive visited, I've had a great time. I went in mid May, leading up to the 60th Anniversary of the park. It was quite busy during this time. I purchased a 3 day pass to both parks for USD$292.88. This gives me access to Disneyland and California Adventure.If you are going here for the first time, I would suggest this   do all your rides in the morning, and the sightseeing in the afternoon, as you will be waiting, (depending on what day you go), up to an hour or more. But if you are clever, you will keep an eye out for waiting times, as they can decrease over lunch time. I found this out whilst waiting to see Mickey Mouse. When I originally looked it was a 60 min wait, so I went for a walk, took some photos, then came back about 15 minutes later and found that the queue had gone down to 15 mins.The park is always clean, and there are lockers where you can store your goods that you have bought instead of carrying them around with you all day. Staff are always courteous and helpful.Also if you are thinking of visiting here whilst the 60th Anniversary is on, well think again. If you like waiting in lines and standing shoulder to shoulder all day with strangers, then go. If not, hold off your trip.The best ride in my opinion is Splash Mountain, (and if you are solo then you basically skip the crowds and get on the ride in about 5 mins).Who wouldn't love visiting here. It really is the happiest place on earth!","Disneyland_California"
626817259,3,"2018-10","Denmark","Having been to other Disney parks, including Walt Disney World, Hong Kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Resort, this park just disappoints at so many levels. Don't get me wrong, the park itself is stunningly beautiful with some very unique touches here and there. Their Discoveryland is amazing, Frontierland beautiful and their Fantasyland has some very nice touches as well. What really boggles my mind is the lack of maintenance and general conditions of facilities, which is HORRIBLE. Toilets were old and in many places weren't clean, you could smell the urine upon entering several of them. It was also the first time ever that we found toilets where soap  and paper dispensers were left empty, floors were soaked in mud and urine.Several food  and snack stalls were closed as well, and the service at quick food vendors were incredibly slow. Sometimes they'd have one line and 2 3 cast members expediting ONE CUSTOMER at once, which meant you'd spend 10 15 minutes on buying a bottle of WATER. In many occasions they were out of main items as well, e.g. one place ran out of waffles, yet no signs were put up to announce this. Another place ran out of coffee, and decided to just send customers to a nearby caf  , instead of getting new coffee for their machine (it's the same coffee and same machines throughout their park).All in all it was a great experience, however, it is far far FAR below standards of other Disney theme parks.","Disneyland_Paris"

It also feels less busy which is nice in all the madness!!!!We only managed 13 hours as we were completely worn out but our little one loved it   and we found a little inner child too. My only point for feedback is the parking is very poorly signposted and could do with more prominence coming off the highway ","Disneyland_California"

511441961,4,"2017-8","United Kingdom","Tips  Plan in advance what you intend to cover. Use the Disney website to choose carefully, what you intend to cover. Every ride on the Disney website has the timings, description, target audience and warnings if any, particularly for pregnancy, those with heart ailments, neck and back problems. Queues are long, for many rides. Plan well. Read the descriptions. Read height requirements.Use the online maps. Mark which rides have FastPass  Arrive early, leave late. Fireworks are post sunset, timings vary based on season  Fastpasses are free; But you can't hold more than two and the second has riders. Early morning on entry, collect a fastpass for a popular ride which you wish to definitely go onto. Collect a fastpass by scanning your tickets at the kiosk close to the ride, every ride suggests a wait time and the popular ones have a fastpass kiosk which suggests the time to come back after collecting the pass. The pass once collected, allows you to enter the ride through a short queue, which you need to enter within a span of time printed on the pass.   Food is Expensive here. Carry what you can.   Water and drinks are Expensive. Carry empty bottles. There are plenty of water fountains  If buying ice cream, remember that it is not allowed once you reach a ride. Oops, they made my son throw his,even in the gentlest of rides.  Plan a popular ride during the parade or just before the fireworks start, the ride would be less crowded then  Some attractions and rides close earlier, example the park train which circumvents the parkFrom amongst the rides we coveredBest rides in Paris for adults   Autopia, Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones    and the Temple of Peril,For All   'it's a small world' (we did this Twice), NEW Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, Autopia, Big Thunder Mountain, Peter Pan's Flight Also good   Casey Jr.     le Petit Train du Cirque, Okay   Les Voyages de Pinocchio, Dumbo Flying Elephant, the Carousel, Tea Cups, Disney Parade, Sleeping Beauty Castle, Le Pays des Contes de F  es ","Disneyland_Paris"

210290245,2,"2014-6","United States","Let me start by saying that I am a huge Disney fan who's dragged my family to Disneyland once (sometimes twice) a year for the last 25 years. Our last few visits have been okay, nothing stellar, but after our visit this year, I think I'm finally ready to hang up my Mickey ears. We visited the first week of June and were surprised to see that Space Mountain was down for refurbishment. Why wouldn't that take place during the off season? In addition, there were prolonged breakdowns of Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain during the ONE DAY we visited. So we headed over to California Adventure, only to find that California Screamin' and the new Radiator Springs Racers were also down for part of the day, and Grizzly River Run was closed for refurbishment. If I am now paying $150 for a one day park hopper ticket, I have some expectations that the rides will at least be working. With all the big rides down, everyone was funneled into the smaller rides, so lines were extremely long.We expected Disneyland to be crowded, but it was absolutely bursting at the seams, and every pathway was congested by 11:00 a.m. We had planned to stay and watch Fantasmic, but the crowds just became too much, and we left at 7:00 p.m. The overall cleanliness of the park left something to be desired as well, with dirty bathrooms the norm, and trash noticed along Main Street. The quality of the merchandise has gone downhill, too, as we found nothing worth purchasing in any of the stores. My daughter was particularly disappointed that there was absolutely no Olaf merchandise (from Frozen), which you think would have been everywhere. Overall, it was a disappointing trip, and the entire family concluded that we did not need to visit there again anytime soon.","Disneyland_California"

ALL of the characters in costume, Mickey, Minnie, and others were WONDERFUL without words portraying the joy and excitement. Multiple characters took the time to spend extra time hugging my little one who didn't want to let go. The park was incredibly clean and well kept.

Arriving into the park is like being on a film set which is quite magical   I couldn   t help but feel quite excited, as did my kids aged nearly 16 and 13! There were realistically on 5 rides which were suitable for teens, what I mean is fast and spinning white knuckle rides and the rest were all a bit more sedate and for younger kids. So naturally, mine did say they thought it had been over rated but I think maybe I should have taken them when they were younger... my bad!Would suggest taking food as pretty pricey at around 40 Euros for a main dish and be prepared for queuing, nearly two hours for one!

I went to the park on a holiday peak day, but the longest line I had to wait on was marked 35 minute wait time but it was only 20 minutes. The Iron Man experience is the only exclusive ride there. Everything else can be found in other Disney Parks. (It's A Small World. Hyper Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters, Winnie The Pooh, etc.). It is missing a lot of iconic Disney Rides   Splash Mountain, Cinderella Carousel, etc.If you don't go to this park, you won't really miss much. I would not call this a must do attraction.

I have found French people wonderful but the staff at this park were quite rude and annoyed at non French speaking people. The ratatouille ride was different and fantastic but spinny. The lowlight for us was when we wanted to have dinner and all of the restaurants were closed (some were closed all day!), and all that was left open was the American hot dog place selling disgusting hot dogs with crunchy deep fried cold onions for    7 and I had to wait for over 30 minutes to be served by people who were confused and staring with glazed confused eyes. Clearly they were understaffed. I wish it had thought to go to planet Hollywood and get a pass to come back for light show. This spoilt our night. Also, we were able to start the day at this park, go to the other for a few hours, and come back here about 5.30pm. ","Disneyland_Paris"

Didn't have very long wait lines for almost everything except in Fantasyland. Good dining food, but not great snacks like at some of the other parks. Would've liked to buy a hot dog or something more than popcorn but not ice cream. A bit small, would only need 1 day there. Easy to get to using the MTR. ","Disneyland_HongKong"

133956944,5,"2011-12","United States","Absolutely magical. Nobody does theme parks better than Disney. For the Disney fan, I'd recommend the  Walking in Walts shoes  tour. You get a personal tour guide, a group of maybe 10 people, a personal listening device so you don't miss anything, to the front of the line on some rides, let into the entry way of the exclusive Club 33, and get a good lunch. There is more, but I don't want to ruin it for you. My wife situated herself next to the tour guide and asked questions when we were just walking. We picked his brain. Remember these tour guides are the Disney fanatics, and we learned SO much. I used to work for Disney and after this tour, I realized that I really didn't know as much about Walt or Disneyland as I thought. Fantastic tour","Disneyland_California"

So we made the trek across the country and I'm glad we did it at least once!First the biggest disappointments   we did magic hours and they only open to sections of the park   total waste of time and money! No classic Mickey Ears ice cream at either of the parks! Tried to get an ornament personalized from our trip and they don't offer it until November and no one could even give me an idea of when. Staff was not as outgoing as the WDW parks   it was just different and my husband and I noticed that most of the staff seemed to be local to Cali. I'm not saying they were rude, but they were not inclined to make anything magical. Was kind of sad! :(Things we loved! It was great showing my boys the first castle. I grew up with Disneyland and hadn't been there since I was about 16   so this was a fun trip. They loved the Matterhorn and Indiana Jones ride (both not at WDW). And they loved the usual faves that had a different twist   Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain. We overall enjoyed the visit. Happy we did it at least once!!!","Disneyland_California"

If it us your little one's birthday on the exact day of visit, go to the  townhall  and the friendly staff will pin a button on your child's shirt announcing that it is his her birthday. This made the day extra special for our little one, each shop we visited, they gave stickers and what nots to our kiddo, he got express chance to have his photos taken with some characters, plus the crew around the park also handed him more stickers to collect. Might be a small thing for us, grownups, but it made the day more special for our child. We loved all the rides specially the Toy Story ones. Our son's ultimate favorite is the Grizzly Gulch ride, it was exciting and thrilling for all ages. The food though was just ok. The turkey leg which wad popular amongst the park goers were bland and gummy. The mickey waffle was ok. Wish they had more options. To cap off the day, the traditional disney characters parade was awesome, well executed and entertaining till the end. If you wish to get to the train going back to the city though, you must start heading to the station before the fireworks is over, else there will be gazillions of people gunning for the trains right after the show. Over all an awesome, magical day for our family. Can't wait to go back!","Disneyland_HongKong"

I am writing my review based on that. I am sure I would not have enjoyed the place as much if we had to go the queues in the heat.The service is great, very service minded people. Fantastic on that aspect!!I love the rides, the fantastic themeing! Some of the rides are quite rough, however. The Aerosmith rollercoaster was too rough for me, I got headache from that one. I do not mind super thrill rides that give me lots of thrill in my belly but this was just shaking around. But the other coasters were good to great. Get ready for quite dark rides, many of them are inside building in very dark setting. so if you are afraid of darkness or want to talk with each other (I am deaf, remember) it might not be good. But if you do not mind being silent for a while just waiting in darkness.... no problems. :)Despite the  no queue  we had we did not have time to visit the Fantasy area (if it is called so? The area with classic Disney themeing and mascots) it was closed quite early and we had to walk back as directed by a lady. Then we undrestood why, it was time to wait for the castle show! Amazing! it took 25 minutes, the whole show!! Light show with movie parts shown on the castle itself, mixed with some effects such as fireworks and fire. Food wasn't so good here. Bad variety of food, lack of nice icecream. Water super expensive. So maybe good idea to bring your own? Souvenirs and toys also super expensive. But that's kind of understandable. I just pity the families with lots of kids wanting their own diadem above 15    each, then toys, then outfits.... Ouch!! I wanted a diadem with mouse ears but decided not to buy. I did buy a small glass to my sister who loves Ariel and a fridge magnet. ;)So in short: great experience with lots of amazing themeing. But expensive, expensive.Forgot to say, great place if you have some kind of disability. Both for the no queue card and for the flat surface, without hills   good for wheelchairs.","Disneyland_Paris"

Mainland tourists barging through without any respect for others. Adults sending on their kids ahead through the queue and then making petty apologies to pass as they queue followed to catch their offspring. On entering theatre for Mickey's Philharmonic it was basically a  free for all  scramble to be seated   no staff to usher patrons across to far side seating which meant that we had to more or less  climb  across everyone to reach end seating. Toilets were very unclean. Cleanliness in food areas however was ok. The park itself is small by American standards but that is not a downside but it's overpriced for what is there. Overall we left the park early cause our experience left us pretty disappointed.

We knew it was a much smaller park but it was still shocking how nice it was to not be so crowded! It was wonderful! We went on a Wednesday and got right on every ride with a less than 10 minute wait. My favorite ride is the Haunted Mansion and I was very disappointed that for Halloween they changed the whole ride to the  Nightmare Before Christmas  theme. Have to say, that was extremely disappointing. The highlight was the  Finding Nemo  submarine ride because WDW no longer has the  20,000 Leagues Under The Sea  ride and it took both of us back to the '70s on that ride. That was a kick.

We got very lucky with the crowds as the longest time we had to wait for a ride was 25 minutes (which was the newly refurbished Peter Pan ride), the rest were all 5 10 minutes. Yes the food was expensive (but that's to be expected) and yes there were a couple of rides areas closed for refurbishment but our park hopper ticket gave us access to enough rides attractions to make a full day of it. My advice to anyone thinking of going is buy a park hopper ticket online as it's cheaper than buying at the gate, take some food   water in a backpack (if you're worried about food prices) and wear comfy shoes as you will be doing lots of walking.

After a good rant and rave we finally got our tickets and entered the park.At first sight the main street of the park is really pretty and it was here we spotted Mary Poppins so we went to have our photograph taken with her, only for her to flinch and move away from us as assume we stood too close to her.We went for some dinner in a cafe on the main street to be charged over 50 Euros for two slices of pizza a cheese toasty, three drinks and a slice of cake.

The staff are incredibly rude, the place needs a giant revamp, they need to have more access to the characters that are meant to walk about, they need to invest money into the park rather than draining the life out of it. Lastly as I said this park is not a patch on Florida, it is very small and outdated and I am in shock that it is owned by Disney let alone being allowed to be run the way it is.","Disneyland_Paris"

The only big difference is the heightened security checks which didn't cause much delay on our visit and were very comforting during the current situation going on in Paris! I would love nothing more than to go back again and would probably visit at a similar time of year as the longest we queued was 90 minutes which I thought was very reasonable. For most rides we got a fast pass or queued for a maximum of half an hour which is no time. I feel that the Disney parks are appropriate whatever your age! I would always highly recommend!

81251072,5,"missing","United States","Loved Disneyland, but I would suggest to the Disney management that it's probably time to shutter Toon Town much like they are doing at Disney World. When it first opened years ago, in the wake of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, it was an interesting novelty and an interesting idea. But now, the trolley doesn't work anymore and serves no purpose. The houses are looking worn and in disrepair. The playgrounds are dangerous with various unsupervised larger children bullying the little ones. Mickey's meet and greet has always been an agonizing bottleneck. The area usually shutters early. Roger Rabbit has always had maintenance headaches. Like California adventure, it has the feeling of being half done...a shadow of what was suppose to be the Hollywood land. Current Disney management has done much to mitigate the harm done to the park during the Pressler era. It's good to have the submarines back, to see the Tiki room preserved, and to have back a great level of service. I would suggest it's time to look at Toon Town as well, much like they are doing at the Magic Kingdom.","Disneyland_California"

The magic just doesn't seem to be there!Right from the word go, the queues were horrendous, and that started with the bag check! Everyone had to go through it regardless of whether they had a bag or not. Then there were queues for tickets before queueing to get through the turnstiles. When it got to the attractions the majority of the queues were a minimum of 45 mins. Even the toilets had long queues.The food we had was expensive and cold. The set menus were really restrictive in that you could only have soda to drink and not have a hot, sorry, luke warm drink in it's place. If you did want to exchange the drink then you had to buy the sandwich, fries and drink separately making it even more expensive!The park is also advertising how it's the 20th Anniversary and what a wonderful celebration there is going on. Other than a few number  20 s on the parade floats and by the main entrance, it wasn't as apparent or as obvious as I thought it would have been. In all honesty if I hadn't seen the adverts, I would have struggled to have told you that there was anything special happening at all. The park was supposed to close at 22:30 but by 19:00 certain areas could be seen to be shutting down with the food vendors and restaurants closed.Thankfully, it started to rain so that gave us the confirmation we needed that it was time to leave.On the plus side, the Big Thunder Mountain coaster is way better than the one in Florida!

All that we expected occurred, but it was worth it. A Disney fan since childhood, I was enthralled by it all. A smile was constantly on my face, even when we were lining up for 90mins. We visted the park and the studios, and i wish we had more time. One day isnt enough! And make sure you stay for the parade, I still have the song in my head. I enjoyed Crush's Coaster the most, it was soooo good!! Indiana jones and the space mountain were also good. Pirates of the Carribean was closed all day, which was annoying as there are not that many rides considering how big the place is. What i disliked the most was the lack of disney themed rides ... as in orginal disney characters. I was expecting a little mermaid ride, or a lion king ride. Something! The closest ride that came to meeting my expectations was Aladdins carpet ride, which is a ride for small children, but still fun. Indiana jones, star tours .. all this stuff i didnt know was disney seemed everywhere!At the end of the day, it was Disneyland, i was in Disneyland. It was totally worth the price, battling the crowds after the parade ended, lining up forever, paying heaps for food and screaming my lungs out on the coasters. Those that say the rides were rough, should stick to the smaller rides, which are plentiful. I would suggest getting souvenirs before doing anything else and getting them to hold it for you, after the parade the shops are packed and overwhelming.

We had a blast.We have been to Disneyland in California and Disneyworld in Florida. This park is smaller than those, but still packed full of fun things to do.It has 5  lands  Adventureland, Frontierland, Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, and Discoveryland.Adventureland has the Swiss Family Robinson house which no longer exists in the SoCal disneyland. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril (which was quite a bit different than the US ones), and Pirates of the Caribbean which was very similar.Frontierland has the Phantom Manor (which was scarier than in the US), Thunder Mesa Riverboat, a shooting gallery, Big Thunder Mountain (a lot of fun on a mine train), a theatre with shows, a play area for kids 4 8, and a Disneyland Railroad depot.MainStreet U.S.A has all the shops and horse drawn street cars.Fantasyland has the castle, which you can walk inside! Snow White, Pinocchio, a carousel, Peter Pan, a Railroad depot station, Dumbo (a flying carousel), Alice, Mad Hatter Tea Cups (a requirement in my book at any Disneyland), Casey Jr circus train, a cruise through fairytales with narration which was all in French and boring for us, Small World, and the Princess Pavilion.Discoveryland had Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast where you shoot at digit images to try to get the highest score in your car, a Railroad station, Star Tours which was so cool to hear the characters speaking French to us, Captain EO, Captain Nemo's submarine, Space Mountain, and Autopia (which my son for whatever reason had no interest in).There are bathrooms throughout, designated smoking areas, and many places to buy food. There are quick eats like a deli, pizza pla ce, bbq place, and a mexican place, but they aren't all open every day. The Mexican place was closed the day we went. We did eat at the Lucky Nugget Saloon and the food was decent.There are also all you can eat buffet restaurants, on in Adventureland, Discoveryland, and Main Street. We ate at the one on Main Street and it was a bit pricy, but it's Disneyland and Paris, what do you expect? It was good with a nice variety. They take reseverations but we just waited in a long line.There are sit down places including the one in the Pirates of the Caribbean called Blue Lagoon and the fancy French restaurant in Fantastyland called Auberge de Cendrillon with the Disney princesses. There are two other American style sit down with service restaurants in the park. It is recommended you make reservations by calling a number on the park guide or heading to City Hall.Of course there are souvenir shops throughout and we liked that we could buy crepes at a desert stand. You can't do that at the Disney parks in the US.Fastpass is an option on certain rides that allow you to get a ticket with a time stamp where you can come back at that time and cut to the front of the line. It can be convenient but you can only have one fastpass ticket out at a time.We had an awesome time, highly recommend it.

603375941,4,"2018-7","United States","This was our first visit to Disneyland Paris as a family and even with the blistering heat we had a great visit. Where do I begin??? The park has a wide selection of rides that we could all enjoy. I travelled with a 2 year old, 6 year old and a 11 year old and my husband. They offer parent swop on the rides so it meant that my husband and I did not miss out on any of the roller coasters my smaller children were too little for. The way parent swop works for each ride can be different. For example on some of them, the parent who has been waiting can just go through the exit of the ride so they don't have to queue, on other rides you are expected to go through the fast pass or single ride queues which can add on some time to you wait. The standard fast pass can only be used to reserve 1 ride at a time which was a bit of a let down but did not spoil our fun. I suspect that some of the other reviews stating that there were not many rides either did not explore the whole of the park   parks or were expecting roller coasters on the scale of the USA parks. A photo pass is worth it if you would like photos of you on the rides although not all rides offer photographs. On our first night we waited an hour and a half at the front of the castle for the fireworks and were to the left of the castle The view from here was good but for a better view you need to be looking straight on. We did this on the 3rd night but unfortunatly many people are very selfish and we had grown men and women who instead of sitting on the floor as many people do choose to do, they were standing which meant some of the children did not have a very good view. The 2nd night we went we were right at the back of main street and although it meant we got out of the park faster after the show, the view was not brilliant. Whilst it is difficult to control very large crowds in this instance I cannot help but feel that there must be a better way to do it?? The parade was good fun although again, if you wanted a decent view you needed to wait for a good couple of hours. Most people wait on main street USA but if you head down to Fantasyland and wait by it's a small world you can see where the parade starts although you will still have to master the crowds to do so. The biggest let down would be the lack of characters in general you see around the park. They have introduced a system by which you can book via an app to see certain characters such as Mickey but unless you get onto it as soon as it is available each morning you have no chance. We managed to get a time for Mickey but this was 5 hours after we managed to access the app. There were a few characters around the park but again unless you happen to get there when the queue opens be prepared for upset children. My child saw Belle who is her favourite charachter who I can only assume by the time we saw her, that she had been there a while, because my daughter was turned away resulting in a full on breakdown and me having to spend 20 minutes calming her down. ;( Whilst walking away we came across several other character queues to be told they were all closed. This was annoying as how can children see all the characters for autographs etc when they were all there at the same time! Food service was slow in several places and is expensive. In Plaza Gardens we waited almost an hour for them to bring our drinks and in the ''fast food'' place (based on Pinocchio   can't remember the name) we had to wait over 20 minutes for our food order to be taken. Breakfast in the studios was not great and again the queues here were long. The preferred part of the Disney experience for us was actually the studio's. It did not seem as busy as the main park itself and as we visited during the Marvel summer of super heroes it was right up our street. Again, be prepared to queue for the rides. If simulators are not your thing then give Armageddon a miss. I love the film but it was not worth the 30 minute wait. Head for Crush's coaster first thing in the morning (as soon as the park opens) otherwise you'll end up with over an hour wait. We had a wonderful holiday that we will never forget at Disneyland but It was not without it's frustrations. We went for 4 nights   5 days which we still feel was not enough time. This review probably seems very negative given that I am saying we had a wonderful holiday but I feel it is important to be honest.

332776484,2,"2015-11","Australia","Don't expect a massive Disney experience, this is the smallest of the Disneylands and doesn't have many rides outside of the really kid friendly one. Large amounts of empty space, gives a sense that the park is half built and that grand plans were not met. One benefit is that on a week day every ride had a wait of less then 5 minutes. Also the temperature on the day we were there was mid 30's and it seems there isn't a huge amount of shelter to stay out of the sun and with vast gaps in the park you have to walk a long distance in the sun between rides.

As soon as you walk out the train station door, you are at the park entrance so it is perfect. Most area hotels drop you off at the entrance as well and offer free shuttle to and the hotel and DisneyABOUT THE PARKThere are 2 parks   Universal and Disneyland. They are equally good and it is recommended that you get tickets for both. We went in May and the line ups were minimal in both parks. Don't forget to check out the fireworks at the end of the night...well worth waiting for and staying up late...you won't regret it!The rides are a lot of fun. Most of the rides are enclosed so you don't really know what to expect. And you can visit the park in the rain! Line ups were not too bad but likely varies depending on the time of year. There were several Single Rider options which were worth it for most rides except the NEMO ride...Crush's Coaster...SO FUN but don't do the single rider because it is a 4 pod and most people seem to be in pairs so it was a long wait when we thought that it would be faster.Security at the front entry takes time to get through so keep in mind when timing your visitNOTE   There are a lot of people selling souvenirs outside of the park near the train station that can be a little annoying but okay if you are looking for some cheap stuffDININGWe ended up eating at the Lucky Nugget twice because it wasn't too busy and the food was okay. The prices were okay. Most restaurants require reservations but there are a few spots like Lucky Nugget where walk ins close to 5p was okay. I would recommend the Ratatouille Restaurant or Pirates of the Caribbean, if you want to make a reservation, spend extra, and have a good spot to sit. The views from those restaurants are awesome.Overall, we loved this place and definitely recommend to everyone of all ages!","Disneyland_Paris"

We got in at 7:15am on 2 different days and were able to do a ton of rides! One day we focused on Tomorrowland and the other day on Fantasyland. The park gets very busy after lunch time so that is when we left to go back to our resort. We came one night for fireworks but it was so busy we didn't stay long. We saw characters when we first entered the park but I didn't see many in the park. This was my only disappointment.

We were there for 12 hours and only got to do six rides because of the wait time and all the people. Parade was great! Kids enjoyed seeing characters on the parade floats and definitely a highlight of the visit. Saw about four of the characters walking around in the park, the others were stationed where you had to wait in line for an hour plus just to get a photo with them. All in all, I would definitely not go in the busy time (although I don't know what is the not so busy time for Disney). We only did Disneyland Park and got through it all in the 12hours we were there. Food and drinks are VERY expensive!!! Prepare to pay at least $3 for a bottled water!

The queue for rides was 10 20 mins and at the height of the day, around 2.00 we waited around an hour.

238446761,5,"2014-10","India","My husband and teenage daughter were in Hong Kong in the last week of October, 2014 and took the opportunity to experience Disneyland there. It was our first Disneyland visit, and we enjoyed every bit of it. Quick tips for those going with families :1) Try and book in advance, preferably from your hotel (place of stay) as the tickets are likely to be cheaper than getting them at the entrance.2) Disneyland can be accessed comfortably through Hong Kong MTR. 2) Week days are apparently better as the place is less crowded and so less wait time for rides.3) The HK Disneyland is very much doable in one day; so think twice before getting a two day pass. 4) We didn't take any food along with us, but found security officers to be quite liberal in allowing outside food to be taken inside. Being vegetarians, we regretted not getting our own food, as the food stalls serve mostly non vegetarian snacks and are a little pricey. Indian vegetarian lunch is, however, made available at Tahitian terrace restaurant in Adventure Land.4) The best thrill rides for adults and teens are: space mountain and grizzly gulch   don't miss these. If you are an adrenalin junkie, go for RC racer; we didn't have the appetite for it. 'Mystic manor' was also wonderful. Don't miss 'It's a small world' and the 'Lion King Show' either. Children will love Mickey's Philharmagic (4D show). Most other rides are mild and well suited for smaller children.Our only regret was, despite repeated tries, we couldn't do 'Autopia', which promised to be a thrill ride in the league of space mountain and grizzly gulch; everytime we tried, we were told the waiting time was 45 minutes!And plan your day well so as to stay back for the parade and the fireworks show. In all, Disneyland gives you absolute bang for the buck.","Disneyland_HongKong"

623768836,5,"2018-8","United Kingdom","We stayed hotel Santa Fe, for restaurants bookings may be worth calling about 6 8 weeks to make reservations, if you don't know when you'd like to eat, you can always queue, best times we found where queuing was a minimum was around 3.15 3.30pm or if you've seen the parade to go then (17.30) as everyone else is at the parade, be careful though some restaurants close early. For the priority pass, the staff ask which category best fits the disability, you can also book a pass for the character meet and greets make sure you get there as the time slots open as the spaces are limited and go really quickly. The pass also gets you priority seating at the fireworks and the start of the parade too. I'd not have gotten half as much done if I didn't have one for my back. I just took my blue badge. You arrange it when you get there at City Hall, can't do it before hand unfortunately.We had our character breakfast at plaza gardens, and ate there for dinner too. We also ate at our hotel, Santa Fe, and Restaurant Des Stars. We had a half board meal plan so everything we ate was included. We took loads of snacks to munch in around the park too. Best thing you can take is refilble water bottles and mini squeezy squash bottles.There's water fountains all over the park where you can refil them too.If you need a wheelchair You can hire one. They're a    75 deposit and    20 euros per day..Can I also suggest research which characters you want to see the most and list them in priority order, we didnt get to see all the ones we wanted. Do the same with the rides, there hundreds of videos on you tube.A photo pass is    69.99 And is well worth the money. You may remember if you've had one in the past, that any photo taken on a ride or by one of the park photographers is uploaded we came away with 92 photos.With the photo pass we had a few issues with photos not coming through for days, it was because there was a photo pass event and their system was jam packed. But it all came good in the end and we got all our photos. Another suggestion then, when you come off a ride that has a photo, when you hand it to the cast member for them to add your photo number, you can check all your photos are on the card. If they are they will download, usually they take about 2 24 hours. Download the photo pass app before you go so you're all set up as soon as you get there.Oooh also download the Lineberty app, you can book some of your meet and greets here for the Disney Park Studios, it's works on location so will only show when you're in that park. When you get there get as many leaflets as you can as this will tell you the times the bookings open on the app.Another good app is the actual Disneyland Paris one. It tells you show times and queue times etc.We went to see the marvel show, stitch live (It's hilarious, prepare to be roasted as they pick on the audience, all in good fun though) we also saw Mickey and the Magician all in the studio Park.In the main park, there's the princess waltz (show) and a meet Mickey and friends thing (also a show) The characters dance on stage for both these shows. There's a disabled area there too. If you're staying in a DLP hotel, make the most of your magic hour, you get some great castle shots with no one else in the picture.Also hold back after the fireworks usually about a half hour for the smoke and other people to pass. You can get some lovely photos of the castle lit up with no one else but you and your family in the picture. The cast members are usually ok with it as long as you don't take the Mick. People tend to be really helpful too and take your family photos for you so you can all be in the shot. It kinda gets like a conveyer belt but people are happy to wait as they all want the same photo.Oh and when people say Disney makes magic.... They aren't wrong. I can't explain it but for the few days we were there it was perfection xxxx","Disneyland_Paris"

I did enjoy spending quality time with my family, who are now past the  child  stages. Thank god because to be perfectly honest, nearly every child I saw looked beat down and a huge amount of them were having major meltdowns and crying. Disneyland used to mean fun rides, fantasy characters that you could meet, junk food! Now it's theree line just to get in the gate. A line to take a picture in front of Main Street, lines to meet any character, waits over 1 hour for most rides. Children just do NOT enjoy that. They do not have the patience to endure all the standing around. Disney I am sure is much more profitable packing them in to capacity, but they must consider the experience of the folks forking over big bucks. Nobody wants to see their child cry for hours on vacation. It needs to change! I left there sad for all the parents of little ones.

The shows in the park are brilliant and even as a adult you cant help was admire the way the characters interact with all the children.I would go back and I would be a bit better prepared with food I would pack carrot sticks ,bread, snacks and drinks that sort of thing because like I said the food is far to expensive when you have kids with you.I would not use a travel agent next time but do it myself and the bus to the disneyland I would not use and didnt on my last trip I organise a car to pick us up and bring us back to the airport and it was about ten euro dearer than the bus ,saved us about 45 mins in waiting time.all in all ours time there was great just sort out the food issues and the place would be excellent.","Disneyland_Paris"

But here is the major issue, the  cast members  were very unpleasant.  Maybe I'm bias because I am an annual passholder at WDW and so was my friend who I went with. Both of us were so surprised by how many unhappy people worked there.  We met 3 cast members who were amazing but as the day progressed the level of disgruntled employee progressed as well. They were unknowlegable or just dismissive. They didn't want to pin trade and made it seem as we were annoying them when we asked.  I get that it was a hot summer day but these are paid employees of the Disney brand, they need to step up their attentiveness and be more likable.

72680742,1,"missing","United States","First, this is the only review I have ever written  I have noticed that Disneyland has felt less and less personal the past few times we have gone (we are southern Cal. residents). It seems that what was once a well oiled machine, has become very robotic and cold (not to mention $$$$$). Number one: Beware of the guy at the nearby Marriott (an employee of Disney) who sells the tickets to Disneyland. We had three families all staying there to avoid morning traffic as we were to meet an entire kindergarten class the next morning. We all bought our tickets at different times, however when we met up for dinner, we had all been sold three day tickets, and we were all baffled at how masterful the guy was at talking us up before we knew it. Had it only happened to one of us, you could say it was just one of us being gullible, but all three of us? Number two: Part of the scam was that we (each) asked if it was reasonable to go to the California Adventure for the light show (since we had a night to fill). Without any mention of anything extra needed, we were sold these three day things so we could view the show. He told us the time of the show, but neglected to tell us that a fast pass is required (and those are gone by mid morning usually)  So, we all have our $$$ 3Day passes, and keep our 10 very young children up late by going to a very loud restaurant on Disney Way (all restaurants had long waits). Then, we go into the Disney Adventure to see the light show, and we just keep getting ushered down a street by  cast members  with flashlights...We think we are being ushered to the show, but after tremendous amounts of walking with now very tired children, we figure out (by asking one of the wavers on) that we can't see the show without a Fast Pass (we did not know what that was). Even though there was PLENTY of room behind a rope surrounding the edges of the street, we were not allowed to either go inside the rope to watch or even stop where we were standing. I don't know if you can imagine, but three Moms and ten tiny children at 9:30PM walking endlessly, and being told they cannot stand for a moment. One Mom stood for a minute with her child to get a glimpse, and security was called. When we promised not to stand, the followed us from behind a little, making sure we kept moving. Needless to say, we were all furious that were sold 3 Day passes only to miss the whole reason we bough them  A pure scam. Number three: Disney Customer Relations: After all this, I at least wanted my money back for the night we just walked and were not allowed to do anything in the Park. The customer service was the worst I have ever encountered. Instead of acting sympathetic, they were cynical and argumentative. The person I spoke with loved to talk, and would give long explanations for why they actually did nothing wrong.

Kids also loved the parades.It is a great shame that none of the  characters  were wandering around the parks   as in the USA   to meet and greet. That would have excited the children. They were only in the hotels (limited times) and Cafe Mickey (which you need to book days in advance).Usual French attitudes (and efficiency!), not like the USA. If something goes wrong, they shrug their shoulders!Don't bother with the gallopers (you know, the traditional slow roundabout with horses). The queue moves painfully slowly because, although the ride is only about 3 minutes long, it seems to take about 20 minutes to load up, because they have seatbelts and check each and every rider is using theirs!","Disneyland_Paris"
617393772,5,"2018-9","United Kingdom","We have just returned from this magical place and what a treat it was. We took 3 nights in a local hotel and 2 days at the parks and 2 days was just enough. My young boy is 10 and he wasn't really interested in anything Disney. He was more interested in all the thrill seeking rides,the bigger ones. Disney is more geared towards younger kids although saying that my son did really enjoy the trip. The family orientated rides had an average waiting time of about an hour however there are fast passes available for certain rides. The bigger roller coasters had a waiting time of about 25 minutes which was great. I personally loved the magical kingdom. The buildings, the castles and all the architecture. The Disney parades happen at 5.30pm each evening and the fire works were at 9.00pm each night. The only downside to the park is the cost of food and drink. My son loves a milkshake and it was 10 euro for one and a small glass of wine was 8 euro. A half pint of beer was 6 euro. Most of the restaurants were approx. 35 euro pp and 26 euro per child. Just a lovely experience.","Disneyland_Paris"

It is currently the 25th Anniversary, and the park has had a few nice twists added to make it feel even more special. We have to start with how friendly all the staff were and accommodating. I think they took pity on me trying my best GCSE french from the 1980's and would always talk to me in English. Some even helped me along. :)Where to begin, the park is beautiful, breathtaking and to pinch a Disney word... magical.We were visiting with people in our party with disabilities, and were allowed to obtain fast passes for the rides. we would like to thank Disney for this offer as it made the time more special for the children. A little reprieve from the rest of the year.We were lucky to meet a few of the Princesses and this was the highlight for the children. Along side meeting Mickey and other characters.The park has a great mix of rides for young and old. Shame Hyperspace mountain was closed, as it was closed 2 years ago wen we went. (i'll get on it one day)We were blessed with sunny weather throughout the stay as well which certainly added to the charm.The afternoon parade is fantastic, but go early to get a good view at the side of Main Street. Well worth the wait. And to top it off, the evening show and fireworks are simply stunning. My advice is get a central spot as far forward as possible. Thank you Disney, already planning our next trip.","Disneyland_Paris"

Lines for most rides were short   except for the Railroad. We waited in line for nearly an hour   they simply weren't running enough trains. Occasionally we found staff to be short and rude.

Our 4 year old son who the trip to Disney was for, had a nasty accident at the newly opened toy story land. I was extremely impressed that the incident was immediately noted and within 2 minutes security and a nurse were on hand. During that time a member of staff stayed with us. Thankfully the nurse could deal with the situation with her medical kit. We were very thankful for the help and really impressed with the speed of attention. The whole park is very clean and well maintained alsoOn the other side of the coin..... Be prepared for long waits for the rides. This is far from ideal with little kids. This is an aspect that i had trouble tolerating. We deliberately went on a Monday thinking it would be quieter than the weekend but no. There is apparently a fast pass but I didn't see much evidence of it. Obviously a family trip to Disney isn't going to be a cheap exercise. The shop was a huge temple to the Disney brand.....

543609341,5,"2017-11","United States","Disneyland is a place to visit that is as good as it gets. I told my husband that we can learn a lesson from humanity by going to Disneyland. You wait in long lines, walk through crowds, wait a long time to get food and drinks during busy periods, you tote children around of all ages, and you do it with patience and a smile, because you're at Disneyland. And  nothing bad happens at Disneyland.  I saw people with screaming babies, and they handled it in stride. At the end of the day, Dads and Moms alike were carrying toddlers through the park, waiting for their bus ride back to the hotel, exhausted beyond words, but they smiled and waited patiently. They could have been grumpy, but they were not. After all, we had just spent the day at the Magic Kingdom. Maybe this isn't a review, but more of a tribute to my fellow Disneyland goers on the virtue of patience, humility, graciousness and peace.

If you go to both parks in one day, I recommend you to start in Walt Disney Studio, because it close at 7pm and Disneyland Park closes at 10pm. In Walt Disney Studio I loved the Hollywood Tower and the Aerosmith Roller Coaster. In Disneyland Park there are many roller coaster, places to eat, shops to buy souvenirs and a magnificent castle where there are a princesses's dance and a magical show about the princesses's stories with fireworks along the tale.

The queue times weren't as long as I expected and for being a theme park, the prices in my opinion weren't outrageous. I'd definitely recommend staying at a Disney resort if you go, due to the fact that you get into the park and can ride earlier than those who aren't staying on a resort. The only complaint I have about the whole experience was in regards to the light up fireworks event we attended. There weren't handicap platforms to elevate wheelchair bound attendees for better viewing, and there wasn't a safe way to exit mid show in case of emergency. A simple roped off aisle way through the center of the downtown area would make anyone in need of medical attention, reachable and at the moment, in my opinion, the whole event is extremely dangerous.","Disneyland_Paris"

It was just a photo opportunity with person in Ironman costume who used pre recorded voice. The Moana: A Homecoming Celebration is outdoors in a half covered venue. Also cheesy, but the kids seemed to like it. The Moana character sorta looked like Moana. The ladies might want to watch the movie again to do hula correctly.

Off from Indonesia  a 5 hour sky distance from HK  we were all geared up for a full day of fun. Kids were looking forward to it, a full pay off after midterm exams. That morning, we came early with loads of kids' neccessities and my personal photographic gears. Kids' stuff included raincoats, spare clothes  as it was pedicted there would be light showers and for getting prepared for some wet actions. My personal photographic gears included those heavy full frame DSLR body and lenses  as my visit to the park wouldn't be complete without taking some great shots of my family with famous backgrounds such as Disneyland.I packed all those gears in one plane cabin sized roller bag, thinking that it would be too heavy to carry around. What an unpleasant surprise I received from the gate attendant that morning, instructing that I should take out all the heavy gears and leave the roller bag at the deposit counter outside the park at HKD 60 fee. It wasn't the fee that made me upset, but the fact that they commanded me to carry the heavy loads without a roller bag. They even said:  You could take turn carrying them since you have 10 people with you!  What a statement! I thought to myself:  Doesn't she see half of my group consists of children? What a thoughtless statement to have small children carrying heavy loads around while they should have fun riding and enjoying the park's variety of treats and snack? What disappointed me was that there was no precaution whatsoever made to me prior to my coming  whether on the website or at the tickets agency that visitors should NOT bring any roller bags into the park. I ended up carrying all the heavy loads around on my back. Imagine bringing those around for 11 straight hours! I could not enjoy one bit of my visit to HK Disneyland this time, even though still trying hard to take good pictures. We went back home with my back hurt. It was such a hurtful treat from the staff at Disneyland having such a mindless service to visitors like us. I do not know the rationale behind this rule. I could only guess  it could be for security purposes, or commercial purposes. The latter being to stop visitors for not spending to purchase foods offerred from inside the park, if they bring ones from outside.I do not know exactly their reasons, but one thing that had left me with after visiting the theme park, and that is being hurt and disappointed. For those with similar case with me, I suggest they call in first or better still, do not carry heavy loads into the park.

He needed a break and this was only time we could find along with 100,000 other people. Main purpose was to see CarsLand, which opened right after we were there with Jim in 2012. He enjoyed CarsLand and all it's stuff immensely. So much we came back here for our third day of our 3 day pass. We also enjoyed Disneyland too and consider the whole thing to be  Disneyland .

Disneyland Hong Kong is small compared to the other Disney parks so you can easily do all attractions in a day and in hindsight we should have just bough the one day pass. It is best for families with small children as there aren't many rides and attractions for older children and adults.We went in August and it was very hot and humid and also very crowded. Waiting 30 to 90 minutes for the most popular attractions is not fun especially with small kids, but I guess with the summer holidays this was to be expected. Visitors don't always respect queuing rules and there was a lot of pushing, which we are not used to and it was very uncomfortable. We did get fast passes for some of the rides which worked well. We also had to wait about 25 minutes to get into one of the restaurants for lunch and it seemed there wasn't enough capacity in the restaurants in the park to accommodate the crowd. There is only one restaurant that serves western food.We came by taxi which was very quick and convenient, no issues at all.","Disneyland_HongKong"

End of November and the place was packed so I dread to think what the summer holidays are like. We did a 1 day  sampler  and I can see why they say you need at least two days to see it all, what they really mean is in an 8 hour day you spend at least half the time queuing thus sampling only 4 5 rides. The car coach park is a long walk from the parks, what about courtesy electric buggies for the disabled? At 15 euros for cars and 20 for coaches I'm sure they can afford it! 40 euro adult entry, 36 euro for kids you can just about stomach but to be fleeced on everything else is taking the  mickey  ( pardon the pun )! Food and drink was extortionate, 10 euros for a  deluxe  8 inch hotdog in a pappy roll with no mustard or onions, and 10 euros for for a coke and coffee because when you ask for a straw they  sell  you a Carlos Fandango Disney one. At one kiosk they wouldn't honour the 8.95 euro offer despite protestations, was it simply because we were English? Shopping for clothing ( All made in China ) at Harrods prices, 22 euros for a sparkly kiddies T shirt, or nick knacks also drained the pocket. In places a lick of paint wouldn't go amiss as it's beginning to look a bit tired especially the Hollywood hotel who's neon sign needs looking at! The only characters we saw in the park were Poo Bear and a tiger who's name escapes me, Disney was built on Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy and Goofy but they were conspicuous by their absense only to be seen at the highlight of the day, the parade. Here perhaps I can see where some of our money went, the floats were superb in all respects and for me the lasting memory, after my empty pockets, of a day I will NOT be repeating anytime soon.","Disneyland_Paris"

I was shocked and disgusted to see so many people sucking on cancer sticks around children. This may be culturally acceptable but I cannot believe the Disney corporation would accept this as okay. At least Tokyo had smokers sections in the park (aka Cancer Corner) where people can destroy their health. Poor form Disneyland Paris. Another blight on the park was the number of gobs of chewing gum on the ground which looked like they'd been there for years. Probably another culturally acceptable behavior but not very Disney like in my opinion. The castle is the best castle of the 4 parks we've been to.

The signage was also in short supply, we had to hunt around for ages for toilets   why don't they put up maps in the park with 'you are here signs'.Some of the French employees should also undertake extra Customer Service courses as many were rude and abrupt, even at the EuroStar enquiry desk in the train station.My party, and some others, felt that the introductions to some of the rides should have been in English and not in French as many other nationalilties also understood English but not French.

Rest assured, your kids are denied NOTHING here    save your money (and sanity)Granted, we did visit over Christmas vacation, and I expected crowds and very long waits, but two and a half hours??? To get motion sick on the Star Wars ride?!?What really broke my heart was right off the bat, we stopped at one of the restraunts that offered a breakfast buffet with Minnie and Friends. I certainly did not expect a bargain, but I noticed the cash register tally over $90.00 after I stupidly handed over a credit card without questioning the prices first. That is for brunch for two adults and two kids ages 11 and 13. That did however include getting your meal interupted by Minnie, Goofey,, and Tigger attacking and harrassing you while you are trying to eat. My point is how many parents could afford this meal after shelling out $420.00 for ONE day passes and why are the prices not posted if they insist on this corruption at least? The only thing magical about this place is how fast you can max out a couple credit cards.The higlight of our ten day trip driving through the beautiful American West for our kids was seeing the Pacific Ocean and playing on the beach, Disneyland was the only disapointment of the entire trip.

188701203,4,"2013-12","United States","I generally like Disneyland better than Disney World; it feels more manageable to get through, even when you include California Adventure. And of course, it is amazing in many ways, as one would expect from Disney (and the admission price tag). We were there a few days before Christmas and the crowds were almost unbearable   it was difficult to walk and we couldn't get on many of the classic rides because lines were just too long. But I can't blame Disney for its popularity. That said, my five year old was really overwhelmed by the crowds and was disappointed multiple times by how hard it was to meet characters. We did get lucky and meet a few, but the lines for some were hours long and moved painfully slowly. Even when characters were on the streets, it seemed that every time we approached a line, a cast member would close the line and tell us to come back later...as a disappointed five year old with an autograph book in hand stood there in disbelief. It happened to us half a dozen times in one day. I understand that the cast members in character need breaks, but there has to be a better way. We did have an easier time meeting characters at Disney World (as compared with Disneyland) where they did a better job of keeping the lines moving. On a positive note, my son loved the parades, and was happy as could be once the sun set and the park was lit up (which was beautiful).","Disneyland_California"
581160653,5,"2018-5","Australia","We travelled as a family consisting of 5yo, 7yo, 15 yo, adults in our 30s, 40s and 60s. We went over several weekdays and no problems with queue wait times  the longest was Parachute Drop (20mins approx) and we really should have gone on this one earlier in the day, as it is a notoriously longer afternoon ride wait.There are just so many Character Meet n Greet opportunities, it was fantastic.Do not miss the beautiful Fairy Tale Forest!Weather: Humidity ranged from 75 95% and temp 24 31degC. Some days were sunny, mostly days were cloudy and some with light showers. There was probably only 1 day we could say it 'rained'.We had small plastic bottle sprayers that we pre filled with water and left in fridge the night before  it was so refreshing and cooling on our really hot days.Another great idea I had read on the disneytourist blog, is to use small gym chamois type cooling towels. These were fabulous to have  I bought ours from Target for $5aud ea, they really helped in the warm weathet. The night before, wet the towel thoroughly, seal off in a tied sandwich freezer bag and put in fridge overnight or for a few hours. During the day as towel dries out just wet it again under a cold water tap.I suggest downloading the Disneyland Hong Kong app (great for map, character times, queue wait times the Park has limited WiFi)With two parades, three shows, an evening Light Projection Show in Main St (instead of fireworks whilst Castle is under maintenance) , approx 17 rides things to see plus numerous Character opportunities, at the minimum I would suggest a 2Day ticket. If you are staying longer, look at a Magic Access 12month pass)  most of our party purchased a Silver Magic Access Pass (no weekend entry) and we went 3 4 different days. We didnt have to rush around and we got to do our fave rides more than once or twice.The Silver magic access pass also gave 10% disc on merchandise shopping and 10% off at character dining and sone general dining in the Park (or had meal deal free drink kind of offers).Fave rides? I would say Iron Man ; Runaway Mine Cars and for my daredevil brother it was Hyperspace Mountain. But we really did love most of them. Glad we got to see Festival of the Lion King, as this is about to change to Moana show.We had 2 (cheap) strollers we left in the stroller parking area many times , no problems there with anyone stealing them!Because we went to the park on weekdays, we had no issues with long wait times (plus we tried to do the popular ones earlier in the morning eg Parachute drop) .We tried to ask the children which Characters they REALLY wanted to see eg their Top 5...otherwise it can be time consuming (not to mention exhausting in the hot sun) spending lots of time queuing up. I found it beneficial to check Character times before we left and noting down the times and location on a piece of paper, spread out throughout the day based on their 'must see'! We started queueing 5 10min before so we were in the line several times we arrived 10 15 mins from the start time and they had already closed the queue due to so many people. Mickey and Minnie seemed to have the longest lines.We dined at The Enchanted Restaurant at the Disneyland Hotel  it is approx 15 minute walk from admission gates of the Park. We absolutely loved it, we dined mid week 5:30 7:30pm and from around 6:00 7:15pm we had Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Pluto. They come separately to every single table and the official photographers come too. Their helpers will also take pics with your phone and cameras. And the food!

We did expect this and made sure we enjoyed what was available within the park to the fullest. I would liked to have seen more characters walking about but I can understand that there's not much point when there's barely any kids there. I think many of the negative reviews come from people being unprepared for the prices and the time of year they go. Most of the rides were amazing, as well as all the available food and the parade.

You step into a whole other world once you enter the park. As with every Disneyland park, every detail is taken into consideration and fits within a magical world, from small details like doorknobs and trashbins to large castles and jungles. What could have been a great experience was unfortunately marred by several interruptions that seemed to be either planned or badly managed. The Lion King show was really good, with a number of talented dancers and singers in impressive costumes   definitely a must see   but it was interrupted twice with what appeared to be planned interruptions. All the dancers ran out twice, giving the (perhaps malfunctioning) mechanical animals time to move to a different position, but it honestly ruined the flow and experience of an otherwise fabulous show. Because it seemed planned, I'm not sure this was just a one time unlucky occurrance. The other  interruption  came at the street parade, which was suddenly cancelled 5 minutes before the show was to start, with something like  unstable weather  being the reason. Problem was that it had not rained all day, didn't rain, and the weather forecast had not changed. Maybe the mechanics can't handle rain... but then honestly, you plan for it. Conclusion? If you come during the rainy season, even if it doesn't rain, you may not get to see the shows. When I pay top ticket prices to visit an amusement park (499 HK$ for adults), I expect the quality to be topnotch, every day. If I had paid less to visit this place, I would give more leeway, but if they set expectations and prices high, they need to live up to those expectations. I couldn't shake the feeling that for the park this was  just another day  that needed to get over with. Know that queues were long ish (20 40 minutes), even on a weekday, so bring patience a book. Tried the Jungle River Cruise (quite charming and casual), the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (cute, mostly for kids), Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars (not as scary as it looks), Mystic Manor (really well made) and Space Mountain (not as crazy as the one in LA). Most, if not all rides are kid friendly. Fireworks at the closing of the park is definitely worth staying for, but expect to take a while to get back to Hong Kong city as everyone will leave at the same time. Food is expensive, e.g. water comes at 25 HK$ (the free drinking water provided in the park doesn't taste good) and icecream at some 32 HK$.","Disneyland_HongKong"

As to shows, go see them all. They were so much fun and amazing. Even some shows are in multiple languages at once, it only adds to the charm. Lion King was my favorite.

536283755,4,"2017-10","United States","I have visited 4 Disney parks so far and Hong Kong Disneyland is very small. The signature castle is very small!! Super small!! Some rides are different and some rides are missing like pirates of my the Caribbean, haunted mansion. The small world ride is longer, it last longer!! But they have less little puppets. They don't have the delicious and famous turkey legs!! In October several restaurants were closed. Something that was really shocking for Disney was people who work there did not speak English or spoke English very limited. Really a shame, In Paris, and the USA most of them are bilingual. Here you have one tip, if you are going to buy your tickets on line buy them with the 3 meal plan, you would pay 30 US dollars per person more but just one main dish for lunch is 20 US dollars, ( and you would get a snack, lunch( main dish plus soda) dinner (main dish with soda) and a discount for a beverage) so it definitely is worth it. And you can finish the park in one day.","Disneyland_HongKong"

We did Disneyland on Friday the 6th and didn't know what to expect since it was spring break time. We actually got to do everything we wanted and didn't have to rely on the FastPass even thought I highly recommend using it when possible. We rode our favorite rides at least twice and were done in 7 hours. It did start getting busy after 5pm but we were winding down about that time.

Been to Disneyland in California at Easter before and to Disneyworld in Florida 4 times in the last 5 years. The French version seems to lack atmosphere, had far fewer staff, poor sign posting, French people who didn't seems to feel that they had to wait in line like everyone else for a ride and infact 2 of the rides broke down whilst we were in the queue. We made the best of the place but I'd rather save my money and go to USA instead given that several of the main rides were also closed. Love Disney but felt very disappointed by this experience.","Disneyland_Paris"

Lots of people using fast pass, but at   60 for a few days, it is an item. And this slows down the queue for everyone else. Would also like to see beer tents knocking around for the occasional refreshments.That said, it   s an excellent attraction. The youngsters loved it, and so did the adults.

120172878,4,"2011-11","United States","I seem to have gotten lucky and picked the right day    Wednesday 2 November 2011    when crowds weren't too big and the weather was pleasant. We found waits varied tremendously; in a time period between noon and 4pm they were: Indiana Jones  10 mins; Space Mountain 20 mins; Haunted Mansion 25 mins; Thunder Mountain Railroad 45 mins; Pirates of the Caribbean 50 mins.Having visited the Walt Disney parks in Orlando each year from 2002 04, I had to compare the Paris location with Orlando. We lucked out and had a pleasant weather day in Paris, comfortable in light jackets. And, thankfully, even though schools were out for All Saints break, this Wednesday was not overcrowded.Biggest negative in the park were the number of smokers among the guests. As an American, I just couldn't get over the number of guests letting that cigarette burn dangling from your hand in front of the baby carriage. My daughter and I both felt headaches coming on from the amount of cigarette smoke. The other thing that was striking was the European tendency to wear dark clothing, to me, tended to drag down the mood. I can just imagine being a staff member trying to cheer a crowd that is a sea of black, gray and brown bundled up blobs. I've never been in any amusement park with so many slack jawed and frowning faces.Unlike several commenters who say the staff is not as ebullient as staff in the American parks, I thought the staff were consistently good and upbeat. Plus, multilingual. Also, many commenters say the food is outrageously expensive. We got a chicken burger meal (fries plus large drink) for    9.99, which I figured was reasonable enough for a captive audience. And, I saw the park allowing people in with fairly extensive amounts of food and drink in their backpacks    which was very much frowned upon at the Florida parks. The rides seemed well maintained. When service was disrupted on Space Mountain, everybody got a FastPass good anytime for the rest of the day, which was great. Plus, transport to the park via RER was a real bonus. I love that the Disney Park, Disney Studio, and Disney Village are all together with the transportation bringing you to the park.Finally, price. I found the $72 per ticket for a one day park hopper (we started the morning at Disney Studios) reasonable. Ticket was purchased on line at Disney site in US dollars and was good for any day within six months of purchase.","Disneyland_Paris"

245118592,4,"2014-12","Singapore","Overall, it is a pretty good place to spend the day. Being a smaller park, the rides are shorter and slightly different from the other Disney parks     Mystic Manor (a less scary version of Haunted Mansion), Tarzan   s treehouse (similar to Swiss Family but you have cross the river to get here, a la Tom Sawyer Island), Big Grizzly Mountain (Big Thunder Mountain)   you get the drift     but are quite nice on their own. I actually prefer the Big Grizzly Mountain ride here     I think this is a combination of Expedition Everest (going up the hill and then reversing) and Big Thunder Mountain. Food wise, HKD is definitely cheaper and better than its American counterpart. We had lunch at the Royal Banquet Hall (4 full meals   fruit juice and dessert), multiple snacks and light dinner, and we spend HKD$578. For a family of 4 at a Disney park, this is not bad at all. Try doing that in Orlando! My absolute favorite, apart from the rides, parades and fireworks is actually the Festival of the Lion King     again, it is slightly different from the US one (some parts are in Cantonese) but for some reason, this combination of languages worked to its advantage. My wife actually said she had chills during the show     it   s that good!Oh yes, if you wanna save more money, do get tickets online (various sources). What the website will give you is a printout which you can scan at the automated machines to the right of the park entrance for the actual tickets. It   s pretty straightforward and quite easy to do.","Disneyland_HongKong"

Use the Fast Pass to help manage your wait times at various attractions. And be prepared for the cynics in your crowd to experience the magic.

610309146,5,"2018-8","United Kingdom","We had a wonderful trip to Disneyland Paris in August 2018. Make sure you do your homework first to get the most out of it though!First things first   try to avoid the weekends. If you can go through the week as it is less busy. Common sense really but worth saying. We waited a maximum of 50 minutes in a standard queue throughout our trip.We got the Magic Shuttle to and from the airport, however not sure we would do this again. For a start it is very hard to find where it is when you come off the plane   it is not signposted until you are there. We only knew we were heading in the right direction as we had researched online first. Also it is quite slow as it has a lot of drop offs. I would probably price a taxi next time.Download the disneyland paris app prior to going   this gives up to the minute queue times and we found them to all be quite accurate. We used this app and a physical map to find out where rides and attractions were as the signposting (or lack of it) was non existent especially if you are looking for a specific ride.As said in other reviews, food and drink is expensive (but then so is every theme park) but you CAN take your own food and drink in. We bought loads of food from home and split them into zipped sandwich bags to do each day. We also brought in non spill drinks bottles and refilled them at the drinking fountains in the park. The only two rides you cannot take backpacks on are both in Walt Disney Studios Park   RC racer and Toy Soldier parachute drop (they have places to store your bag whilst your on the ride though).Magic hours were great (we were staying at a Disney Hotel. This meant you could access the park from 8.30am when the park doesn't open for everyone else until 10am. You need to check which rides are open at this time (click into them on the app) and then have a plan for what you want to do first. Also the meet and greets with the Disney characters in the main park were meant to start at 10 but we saw and queued up for some with the character being out from 9.15 so worth a check.Fastpass   this is the part you need to get right to get the most out of your stay. Not available on every ride but basically if it is you can scan your magicpass card at the fastpass machines near the entrance to the ride and it will give you a ticket with a time to come back later and go through the shorter fastpass queue. The fastpass ticket will also say when you can get you next fastpass ticket. Make the most of them   they do run out on the more popular rides in the afternoon.We found that we could do some rides without fastpass as the normal queue was short anyway   e.g. we go the fastpass for big thunder mountain and then went to do indiana jones and a few other rides before our time was ready to use the fastpass.Another thing to say is these fast pass machines are meant to be switched on at 10am. We were waiting in the main big thunder mountain queue at 9.30 (ride opens at 10) and my son noticed that the fastpass machines were switched on, so we just got our fastpass tickets (timed 10.30 11) and left the queue to do something else in the meantime.Some popular rides do not have fastpass   the most obvious one is crush's coaster which had a 45 min queue in the magic hours but peter pan can build up a hefty wait time. Best to do these early.Shows were excellent   can recommend moteurs live, stitch live, and mickey and the magician. All were free too.Illuminations and firework show were excellent although quite late at 11pm when we went. If there is a threat of rain you will not see any fireworks though. People start reserving spots to see it from 9.30 which is crazy but I suppose if you want the best spot...! Ride times can decrease around then too   just use the app to see what time they finish at.We bought a photopass (currently 70 euro) which turned out to be excellent. Basically you get a card on a lanyard and a couple of other mini cards. All have barcodes on which mean that your party can split up and still have one. Any ride with a photo or any other meet and greet with a Disney photographer will take the photos and then scan your card and all your photos will load on. You have 10 days to use the service and 1 year to download them off the app that you can download. We have about 70 pictures by the end of the trip and didn't have to carry around physical photos which was great!Height restrictions were great for the kids. Our 6 year old could get on everything bar Indiana Jones. We have been to Portaventura before and the height restrictions were a big problem every in Sesame Land which took the edge off. If you do find a ride that one of your group can't go on then ask for rider switch when you get to the front of the queue   this means that when you get off the other parent can then queue up from a short queue (normally the disabled queue to go on). Another good thing compared to Portaventura is there is a cast member at the START of the queue to measure children   at Portaventura they only measured you when you were getting on the ride which was a pain if the child was very close to the height but they deemed them to not be tall enough and you had just wasted an hour in a queue.If you are staying in the hotels there aren't many plug points in the rooms so a tip we picked up from facebook was to bring a 4 way adapter with one EU plug adapter   this meant we could charge both phones and the children's DVD players at the same time. Such a simple idea but one I think we will do on every foreign holiday from now on!There is loads of hidden stuff and secrets that you will simply walk straight past if you didn't know it was there   have a research google before you go about secrets of disneyland paris and it will really add to your trip. We loved finding the dragon under the castle and the coca cola cooler you can open in Frontierland.","Disneyland_Paris"

The big thrill rides aren't exactly overflowing, but they are fun once on them. Personally I think it can be done in a few days. Not sure if I have enough money to last much longer. It's a shame the food and snack prices are so exorbitant, surely they must realise if they made them more reasonable, then less people would be bringing in sandwiches and eat within.

Could do with more staff here, the park was well staffed and cleaned, all staff are friendly and helpful, the magic hours that you get extra in the park while staying in the hotel r great.

A stunning gliding aerial tour of California's beauty replete with aromas and bursts of wind. It is a stunningly original ride that will soon be brought to Disneyworld. We only got to ride this once as the park closed before we could go a second time  lines for dinner at Downtown Disney lasted longer than expected ...*Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. This is my partner's choice for best ride at the entire resort. It is cleverly constructed free fall elevator ride and was much better than I expected. We rode it twice.*We found the cafe in the Golden State area to be delicious   especially the soups in the bread bowls! Lowlights at DCA:*Monsters Inc  we found it to be repetitive and tedious*the ice cream stand at Paradise Pier is sub parIn Sum   We slightly prefer DCA because it was entirely new to us and we were not expecting as much. DP has some great classic rides and excellent gift shops. Of course, it could always use some more  headliner  rides. Right now, DCA has the marquee rides if not the quantity yet. Perhaps with a few more rides and shops, DCA will have become the premiere park  at least for adults  at the Disneyland resort.

492584948,3,"2017-4","United Kingdom","Purchasing the tickets for this attraction was very confusing. So many different tickets for different things. This may need to be more clearer. When we arrived (by metro) there was a long but quick queue to get in (this was due to bag and security checks. Which is fair. Drinks and food are allowed to be taken into the park. However selfie sticks are not permitted. There are 2 parks at Disney. The first is Walt Disney Studios and the second is Disneyland. We bought the 2 parks 1 day ticket. We are two young women so we skipped most of the kids rides. This was still not enough time as we underestimated how long and slow the queues are to get on each of the rides. I suggest doing a park a day however we were limited for time in Paris and could only fit in 1 day for Disney. We suggest getting here early to beat most of the long queues and to get fast passes for the busiest of rides. My tip would be to do the popular rides first as the queues are shorter in the morning. I.e Tower of Terror, Rock and Roll Roller Coaster and Thunder Mountain as these rides are extremely busy. Lunch time is extremely busy so we skipped and opted for a early dinner. We had a burger and fries in Walt Disney Studios and let me tell you, this is no Disneyland. This is DISMALAND. The staff look so lathargic, so worn out and not interested. They are grumpy and leave food sitting for long periods of time. Not a great reflection of the park. The food is overpriced, cold and the portions are small. I wish I had brought my own food in for dinner. There is no option from the menu just burgers and chips and the restaurant staff where even starting to pack away tables and chairs and the park wasn't closed for another couple of hours! We got out of Walt Disney Studios and headed over to Disneyland where the parade was on. At the time we went it was supposed to be their 25th anniversary celebrations...well it was a bit drab to say the least. We headed over to Big Thunder Mountain, however when we got there is had broken down so we headed over to the haunted mansion ride where it broke down twice when we were on it. Left sitting for periods of time. After this we headed back over to Big Thunder Mountain, where the queue was supposedly 1hr. Ended up waiting for 3 hours. After this the sun was disappearing and so was the time. So we headed back over for a coffee ready for the parade. The illumination show was anyone's guess as to when it started as the map said look at the park program for times but when I looked in the park program there was no time. I had to go through 3 members of staff to establish a start time. Fireworks were good. The only good thing really that came out of this was the app. Definitely download the app as it tells you the waiting times for each ride so you can base where to go to next from the information in the app.   Quite clever really.

Instead, we have seen a big commercial machine. No miracles, no fairy tail. Simply a huge mechanism of earning money. Even to take a picture with your favorite hero you have to wait in a queue 40min and then pay 16EUR for a pic. Also, food...there is no chance to find normal meal in both parks. Only fast food with the prices of an expensive restaurant. Even McDonalds felt like the best food ever after what we have eaten in this Disneyland. Moreover, the parks are dirty   toilets are a disaster. They definitely need more personnel! And last but not least. What disappointed us most of all is that the roller coasters or attractions were continuously broken and paused. Imagine, you stand in a queue for 50min and when you are so close to get into a roller coaster and have a ride they announce that they have a technical problem and you have to get out and come back LATER. This happened to us 5 times in 2 days! We lost half of our time just waiting in a queue and then turning back because of a technical problem. This is NOT ACCEPTABLE for this kind of amusement parks. I must say that EUROPA PARK in Germany is much better and I have never seen something like this there. I will defiantly never go back to Disneyland again.

The only problem, is this place is EXTREMELY crowded. So, if you bear that in mind, and plan your trip accordingly, you can still have a lot of fun while minimizing your wait times for the cool and fun rides.","Disneyland_California"
360191670,4,"2016-3","United States","I have been visiting Disneyland since I was a little kid, but this most recent trip has clued me into the fact that Disney, more than ever, is just a business. I am aware I visited over Spring Break, but I have never experienced the parks more crowded in my life and I've been there over Thanksgiving. It was like a giant sardine can. You don't hardly have any room to move and the lines are all way too long. The increasing FastPass system is making the standby waits ridiculous. I had a 3 day park hopper and the shortest line I waited in was 45min. At this point, the atmosphere and the food are the best aspects of the park. Annual Passholders are rude as are most regular guests. People push, shove, run by you, and don't monitor their children. The basic cost of tickets and food have also increased so much that you are really stretching your budget, or credit card balance, to pay for everything.I'm not saying I'll never be back, but I am much more aware now at how different the resort was compared to just 10 years ago. It's a bit sad.","Disneyland_California"
248242211,5,"2015-1","United States","I loved, loved, loved Hong Kong Disneyland. Is it better than Anaheim? Of course not, don't be silly. But it was fun comparing the differences and similarities. Just a few tips:  If you are near any MTR stop, getting to the park is easy. The very last transfer is aboard a Disney car, and I loved the little Disney touches on it.   We went on two days, a Saturday (after New Years, last day of their Christmas celebration, so naturally a big day) and on the following Monday. Even on the Saturday the park didn't start to feel crowded until early afternoon. We were able to walk right onto rides all morning, and on most of the day on Monday.  The only two rides that had Fast Passes were Space Mountain and, inconceivably, Winnie The Pooh. They freaking love Winnie The Pooh over here. So if you have kids, make sure you get to that one early. In the afternoons the lines there were longer than anything else we saw in the park.   The live shows were great.  The Golden Mickeys  and  Lion King  are both worth seeing.   The  Stitch  encounter is reminiscent of the one with Crush (the turtle from Finding Nemo) in Anaheim. The show I saw wasn't perhaps quite as successful, but with an international audience you are bound to get hit some language barriers. Still fun.   Mystic Manor is a different sort of take on the Haunted Mansion. The effects are great and it is a lot of fun.   We did the drawing class and drew Olaf. The class is only offered in Chinese, but by just following along we had no problems. I still can't believe how they can make it seem like I can draw things, cause I could never replicate that outside of those classes.   Really the only complaint I had was the food. Theme park food is always going to be expensive, and I know this is in Hong Kong. But the Anaheim park has at least a couple of decently priced options. Everything here is pretty expensive. And perhaps it is my own fault for ordering a cheeseburger in Asia, but it was not very good. (And was one of the cheapest options at something like $14 USD)We stayed for the fireworks, which was pretty crowded. We were dreading going back to the MTR to get back into town thinking it would be overrun, but Disney knows their stuff, and despite the crowds were able to get right on a train. TIP: Make sure you have your ticket purchased already. The lines for the ticket machines themselves weren't completely ridiculous, but you will save yourself time buying them earlier. The park is small, so if you were pressed for time one day is enough if you manage your time well. We enjoyed having the luxury of two days and felt like we got to do absolutely everything we wanted to do, including seeing the stage shows twice. Highly recommended for Disney fans!","Disneyland_HongKong"
585622171,2,"2018-6","United Kingdom","All in all, the park and studios are good fun if you and your kids don   t mind the constant walking and queuing. Positives: some really good rides and shows (when they   re not being cancelled), including the end of day illuminations. See below for my faves.Negatives: the drinking fountains aren   t shown on the app, most food choices from the various stalls a fast food style rubbish, you can   t get a decent coffee anywhere (McDonalds was the best    I can   t believe I just wrote that but it   s true); Magic Time (for Disney Hotel guests) is helpful but not all rides are available at that time. And, as you might expect, everything is massively overpriced. Feel that Disney Magic in your wallet!Really negatives: disgusting blocked toilets in more than one location; very poor experience with the Disney hotel (Cheyenne) which put a downer on the holiday.HINTS: the app, while being very far from perfect, is worthwhile having as the queue times are broadly correct (most of the time) and use the Fast Pass system to help skip past the worst of the queues.Best rides for adults and older kids: Tower of terror (scary!), hyperspace mountain, rock and roller coaster and big thunder mountain.Best riders for younger kids (6 ish in our cases, although we all enjoyed these): Ratatouille, Star Wars Tour, the Circus train thing at the top of the park, it   s a small world, Pirates of the CaribbeanBest shows: Mickey and the Magician, end of day illuminations, Moteurs Action and the Studio Tram tour. Pirates and Princesses parade was pretty good too, wasn   t impressed by the Pirate show.","Disneyland_Paris"

46338917,3,"missing","Australia","We had fun after the we got used to the lines, but honestly they don't make it easy. There was very little explanation of what to do, where to go, how to get started. You have to line up to get past the bag check. Then you line up to get to the ticket window. Then the ticketing process is the LONGEST of any attraction I've EVER been to. What is up with that? Then you line up to get in to the park, and then you line up to take a picture, buy a drink, go on a ride.... and so on and so on. We were there at the end of September and supposedly the park wasn't that busy. I can't imagine being there when it was busy. You'd have to wait all day to get on one ride. The thing I disliked the most was the lack of explanation. If you didn't pick up a map at the beginning you wouldn't ever even find a bathroom. There were a slew of people walking around with 1st time badges. It was our 1st time, but we don't know where we were supposed to go to get the badges or whether they made any difference. We had to watch people walking by us in line to figure out that there was a thing called a  fast pass  and then I spent 15 minutes trying to find a fast pass machine with little or no guidance from the park attendant that I spoke to. Once you figure it out you realize that you probably should've saved it for Splash Mountain though... We knew that there would be a parade and that we should reserve a space early, but had no real understanding of the process. It turned out we picked one of the worst spots. We were right at the curb, but only a few meters away from the end of the first section. This meant that we could half see everything without actually being part of it, then when it did move down, we were right at the very end and barely got to see any characters. The fireworks were somewhat the same. Awesome, but I would've preferred if I didn't have to look through a tree to see the narrator (Halloween show). We were there in plenty of time to stand anywhere, but simply chose the wrong spot. Who knew? It seems to me that it's all designed to require you to come back to do it right. I don't know if I like that. We didn't have the opportunity to come back for the fireworks again. Oddly, I found California Adventure easier. Atleast there are plenty of signs to help you get around although still very little guidance about the best place to stand for performances and plenty of line ups (but much less busy than Disney land). Loved that California Screaming Roller Coaster!","Disneyland_California"

612163919,5,"2018-8","United Kingdom","We went for three nights and stayed in the stunning Disneyland hotel in a downstairs accessible room. The park was overall accessible. I could travel everywhere in my electric wheelchair. The train round the park was not accessible. Using my green priority pass, I was able to access meet and greets easily, I could also get on rides quickly. But this was where the downfall was. I have a large electric wheelchair and struggled to get on the adapted ride vehicles so did not go on any rides. I hope Disney read this and when they build new rides and lands as planned, they will make bigger cars to house electric wheelchairs for those of us who can not transfer. There was so much to do with the shows, parades and meet and greets that I was not too disappointed. I am going back in November for Christmas so will review again then.The other frustration as a wheelchair user was the disabled toilets. There was a lot of toilets but many were inside the main toilets which meant those of us who need a place to change were unable to. One single toilet I visited was poor as the toilet was low, it was tiny and I struggled to change myself as my wheelchair took up a lot of room. Despite these frustrations, I loved the atmosphere and certainly got swept away with the magic","Disneyland_Paris"

151563449,5,"2013-2","United States","Living in Orange County, California, I tend to visit Disneyland about 2 3 times a year, and I have a blast every time I go. However, if I had to pay for park admission, three meals, drinks and snacks, as well as wait in all of the long lines, then I'm not so sure my experience would be the same. When I go I usually try to score a free entrance with a friend who works there, or ask for a ticket from family during the holiday season, but I really can't imagine paying full price (upwards of $130 a day for a single ticket) just for admittance to the park on my own. Another helpful hint for a great day at the park without spending a fortune is to bring your own food or drinks to the park. This is allowed and with a backpack or a locker readily available to you it's kind of a no brainer from my perspective. It can end up saving you a ton of money and then you can feel good about putting it towards something like a souvenir that you'll hopefully have for a lifetime. Lastly, for someone who is new to the park it would be smart to learn how to use the fast pass system to your advantage. There are a lot of blogs websites that will tell you how to do this with a simple Google search, and I highly recommend it. The last time I went to Disneyland I used this system (along with single rider) and was able to go on 20 rides in a single day, and only ever waited for over 30 mins for one ride.","Disneyland_California"

Payment by cash u will have to collect at their office in tsim sha tsui. For payment by credit card, we can collect at the airport . As We only plan to go disneyland for this time round , so we opt for credit card payment and collection at airport.Adult is at hkd 615, child at hkd 428.We had a wonderful time at the park! As it's mid week, and it's super hot plus it's the off peak period , considering it's just after many countries summer holiday and before Halloween decor is up, the park is not so crowded . The longest queue was at frozen village which the wait time was abt 20 mins . For all other rides , we just walk in and took the rides in less than 5 mins.My kids are 5,6 and 9 year old . 2 girls and 1 boy. So they love tomorrow land , toy story land and sleeping beauty castle . We didn't do any roller coasters as the kids don't want to .Tomorrow land : we noticed that they are building ironman building just next to the cafe , should be up by 2016 . Something to look forward to . The kids favorite is the blasting game where they shoot the aliens. It's just beside the cafe and merchandise shop . As there were noooo queue, they played almost 10 times! Superd! I love the flying saucer and the autopia. Toy story land: kids favourite is the parachute. No queue for this too . As the parachute got lifted up , we got a birds eye view of the park. When it falls , my heart almost came out together ... Hahah but the kids love it and love our scared expressions ...I love the doggy ride which is like a mini roller coaster .Mystic mansion is something not to be missed . The kids were quite scared by it but as adults , we were amazed by the effects of this ride . Must try if u are there .Parade: there is the usual day parade and the new night parade at around 7pm. I personally loved the night parade very much ! There is a real moving lightning McQueen car and truck! Amazing ! The lights and cast are all very professional ! We are very impressed by this .Fireworks: it's was awesome ! Food wise , we originally thought we buy the meal voucher when we were there, but we were told that the expensive restaurants were all closed that day . So it's not worth to buy the meal vouchers . The cheaper meals cos much less. It's abt HKD100 per set meals for the less expensive meals . As we are sharing the food most of the time , it really cost less than the value of meal voucher . We find the portion of food is quite big , and taste good too !Overall, we had a very good experience in the park !

I am tall and overweight and could not find much information on how this would affect my experience at Disney so I decided to write about my experience. I am 6   4    and let   s just say I weigh over 300 pounds (depression moment: I have to lose over 100 pounds just to be considered obese on the weight chart). I am currently a 48    waist. I will do my best to talk about my experiences as a fat man at Disney as well as offer some tips and tricks about how to get the most out of the trip.Just a little background information: I am a planner. I analyze, plan and execute with several backup plans available, just in case. I purchased a 2 day non hopper pass with the intent of spending one day at Disneyland and one day at California Adventures. I wanted the 3 day park hopper, but my wife convinced me that 2 days is enough. I wanted the 3 day park hopper because park admission is $93 day, but it goes down as you purchase more days. If you purchase a 10 day pass, the cost is only a couple of bucks for day 10. Buying a 3 day hopper pass also lets you get one    magic morning    which allows you to enter one park at 7am (one hour before the general public can enter the park). So, only 2 days for me and no magic morning. I will explain how this worked for my family.I arrived to Anaheim on a Sunday night with my family of 4 (my 13 year old has high functioning autism). We checked in to the Anaheim Desert Inn and Suites. One nice thing about this hotel is that we could go to the roof and watch the Disney fireworks show at 9:30pm (already checked one thing off the Disney Bucket List). The hotel was worth the price and it is soooo close to the park. The hotel was clean, offers free continental breakfast (nothing to boast about, but they have cereal, fruit and pastries). I got the suite, which sleeps up to 6, even though we only had 4. The extra room was nice.On Monday, I decided to go to Disneyland first. I didn   t have the    magic morning    so I was part of the general public. California Adventure was the park that had the magic morning on Monday, so I elected to go to Disney. The family was a little slow that morning but with lots of prodding (from me, of course) we didn   t get there until almost 8:30am (my plan was to be there at 8am to make the most of the day, but I tried not to get frustrated). It seems that many of the Disney guests don   t get there until after 10:30am, so I still was ahead of the general public.More background: I had downloaded an app to my phone that tells me the wait times for each ride at Disney about 3 weeks before my trip. I was able to look at which rides traditionally had the longest wait times and thought it would be best to do these first. I hate to wait longer than 25 minutes in a line. The traditionally long lines are: Indiana Jones, Star Tours, Splash Mountain (especially in the summer), Space Mountain, Finding Nemo, Buzz Light Year, Autopia, Thunder Mountain (closed when I was there), Matterhorn and Peter Pan     Dumbo is just really bad (very slow moving line) all of the time, so if you have small kids, do Dumbo and Peter Pan first.In my situation, I had a 13 and a 15 year old, so we went to Tomorrow Land first and hit Star Tours, Space Mountain, Nemo (not very interesting ride in my opinion), skipped Autopia for now, Buzz Light year. Breakdown of rides for a fat man:Tomorrowland:Star Tours     The lines were not long in the morning. The seats fit me and were comfortable.Space Mountain     Not very comfortable for large people, but survivable. I saw people who were larger than me who were able to fit on this ride, but it wasn   t very comfortable (sometimes the ride was a little painful, but I survived). I sat in front, but I hear the back seat has a little more room.Nemo     I was too tall to comfortably look out the submarine window. The ride is boring, but I was able to enjoy it with my kids.Buzz Lightyear     Awesome ride and I was able to fit just fine. It could handle someone much larger than me.I skipped the other rides in Tommowland so that I could get to one of the next longest rides     Indiana Jones before 10:30am when the park would start getting crowded. We went to Adventureland.AdventurelandIndiana Jones     I fit in this ride just fine and saw people larger than me who fit fine too. Not much to this ride. I didn   t need a Fast Pass, but the park was starting to get more crowded. Line went from 30 minute wait time to over 1 hour after 11am.Jungle Cruise     Fit fine.Tikiroom     Fit fine.Tarzan Tree house     fit fine; larger people climbed around this too.New Orleans SquareI ran over to Critter Country to pick up Fast Passes for Splash Mountain. This was good because Splash Mountain was now a 1 hour line at noon.Pirates of the Caribbean     Fat friendly. Worked great for me.Haunted Mansion     Fat friendly as well. Very large people could fit on this ride. This gets super busy around Halloween.Critter CountryEverything was going well until I hit Splash Mountain. Splash Mountain     I used the Fast Pass and got on the ride in less than 10 minutes. I sat in the front of the boat (log) and this was my first painful experience of the day. I couldn   t fit in the boat and the ride started so I couldn   t move seats. It actually hurt. In the end, I was completely soaked but even worse, my shoes and socks were completely waterlogged. I finally dried out, but my shoes never did and it hurt my feet for the rest of the day.Canoe Ride     This is fat friendly. I was the biggest person on the long canoe but I had plenty of room. The line was not long, but the line moves slowly. You and a paddle make the canoe go around the lake. No motors and no guide rails. Lots of exercise. It did help me dry out.Fantasy LandWe got to Fantasy Land by 3pm. As usual, the lines were all long.Snow White     Classic Disney ride for little kids. I was able to fit on the ride and there were some people who were a lot bigger than me.King Arthur   s Carrousel     Fat friendly. Short line! Lots of people were bigger than me. I even got to ride a horse, but I could not fasten the seat belt around me (too big). At least none of the attendants came around to yell at me for not wearing my safety belt.It   s a Small World     Cute ride. Not the best leg room, but fat friendly. I fit on the ride with no problems.Parade     the Parade starts by the    It   s a Small World    ride, so we were sort of stuck. This was a good place to see the parade though. Main Street is always packed during the parade.Time for a break It is now 4:30pm and the kids are starving. Confession: Yes, I wore a fanny pack. I had lots of granola bars, snacks, water bottles and small candies to keep the family happy. I won   t make the cover of GQ with a fanny pack, but I wasn   t at Disney to make a positive fashion impression. Comfort and convenience are high priority. Ego is low priority. Since the lines were very long, we left the park to go to dinner. On our way out, I grabbed some Fast Passes for Star Tours. We ended up at Denny   s (near our hotel room). I could feed a family of 4 for around $30! If we ate onsite at Disney, we would have spent $60. We got back to the park around 6pm, just in time for the second parade. I did read that Disneyland has the best corndogs. I found the corndog stand just off main street on the way to Tomorrowland, but my corndog experience would have to wait until tomorrow.Back to FantasylandBecause of the parade, we got stuck near the entrance. We were able to wind our way around to Tomorrowland and into Fantasyland. I first grabbed a Fast Pass to Autopia and then to the Matterhorn. The lines were usually 60 minutes long, but with the parade going on, many people went to the parade. The line was only 35 minutes long during the parade.Matterhorn     Tight fit. The last time I went on this ride was 30 years ago. It was awesome then, but different now. I didn   t fit very well in this ride, but I was able to squeeze myself in. It was not the wild ride I was hoping for and had I known what I know now, I would have skipped it and waited for my kids at the exit.Autopia     If you are fat, this ride is a disappointment. I didn   t fit very well, but I was able to squeeze in. Then the worst part     the car engine is really a lawn mower engine (or so it seemed) so my car didn   t go very fast because of my weight. I would have been happier taking pictures of my kids driving instead of being in a car. This line moves very slowly too, so a short line still means that you are going to wait a while. By the way, this ride is really in Tomorrowland, so we went back to the main rides in Fantasyland.Mad Tea Party     These are the little cups that spin in circles. This ride is not fat friendly unless you are going by yourself. I had a hard time fitting in with one other person. I was happiest when the ride was over. Let the kids ride this and you take pictures.Mr. Toad   s Wild Ride     I fit on the ride and people larger than me were able to fit on this ride. Long line but short ride. Great for little kids.Peter Pan Adventures     I skipped this ride. The line was still over 45 minutes long. I saw people bigger than me waiting in line. I did this ride at Disney World and it was fat friendly.Dumbo     Short line, but it takes a long time to get in the ride. I skipped this ride.Small World     Why not. Still fat friendly, even the 2nd time around.Mickey   s ToontownThese are small kid   s rides so my family skipped this area. I didn   t have a prayer to ride any of these rides, but great for little kids. Make sure you have your camera ready to take pictures of your little ones riding these rides.Finish the day in TomorrowlandWe went back to Tomorrowland. Innoventions was closed for the day. This was a bummer since there were no signs that said Innoventions closes early.Captain EO     This is a 3D movie and we made it to the 8:30pm show. Seats were great for me. Michael Jackson stars in this film. This is the same show from the 1980   s. I don't want to spoil the show, but I will just say I loved it because I got to sit down for over 15 minutes in an airconditioned theater.Buzz Lightyear     2nd time is still great for fat people. Lines move fast.Fireworks show at 9:30pm! I stayed at the Anaheim Desert Inn and Suites and was able to view the fireworks from the roof the night before, so I felt like I could skip the fireworks show.Orbiter     The Fireworks show took everyone out of line, so we went on the Orbiter. It was able to fit on the ride but not by much. I wasn   t able to move up very fast because of my weight, but it did work.Star Tours     I was able to use my Fast Pass from earlier that day. It surprised us because it was a totally different ride. We finished the night riding this 3 more times and the Buzz Lightyear one more time. It was worth waiting in line for the 20 minutes each time.We left the park after midnight. Our feet were still wet and were now hurting a lot. Just think, we will probably get 5 hours of sleep tonight and do this all over the next morning. We cursed the day we went on the log ride. At least we survived Day 1 at Disney.Recap: Get there early to avoid the crowds. I started in Tomorrowland and worked by way clock wise from land to land until we ended back in Tomorrowland to finish out the day. We got to ride almost all the rides in one day (we rode all of the rides that we wanted to ride and then some).Day 2After an 18 hour day, the family wasn   t ready to get out of bed too early. We didn   t get to California Adventures until 8:20am. Before doing anything, you need to stand in line to get fast passes for 1) Radiator Springs Racers and 2) World of Color. The line for Fast Passes for Radiator Springs was very long, but moved fast. By the time I got my fast pass, our time for Radiator Springs was 4:45pm     5:45pm. If you don   t get the Fast Pass, you will end up waiting 2 hours in line. The next Fast Pass is the World of Color (by the Bear River Run ride) and we got on the 9pm show. Now we can finally stand in line to go on rides. This park is fairly fat friendly, except for a couple of rides, which I will explain later.Our strategy was to start in Condor Flats and work our way counter clockwise around the park. Lines don   t get too long until after 10:30am.Soaring over California     Very fat friendly. I didn   t bother with a Fast Pass and waited 30 minutes.Bear River Run     No thanks! After getting wet yesterday and suffering with wet shoes, there was no way I was going to do it again. People larger than me were able to fit on this ride.On to Paradise Pier. One of the longest lines for a line that you cannot get a fast pass for is Toy Story Midway Mania. I grabbed a Fast Pass for the California Screamin    and went to the Toy Story line.Toy Story Midway Mania     Long lines all day and they just get worse. We waited about 40 minutes in line. Very fat friendly and fun for all. There were people a lot larger than me that fit fine.King Triton   s Carousel     The line wasn   t too long (10 minutes). I could sit on the sea creature, but I couldn   t fasten my seatbelt.California Screamin        We used our fast passes and got on within 6 minutes (instead of waiting 45). I was worried about this ride. Usually, I am too big for roller coaster rides, but I was able to fit in the front of the car. It was a little tight and would have struggled if I was larger.Mikey   s Fun Wheel     There are two lines; one for the car that slides around as the wheel goes around and the other is a stationary car. I went in the sliding car and waited about 35 minutes. I could have been twice my current size and I would have fit.Silly Symphony Swings     Not the most comfortable for large people. Line moved quickly. I could fit on this but not very comfortable. I didn   t see other people my size or larger riding this ride.Jumping Jellyfish     I didn   t even try. Looked like a kids ride, so I didn   t go on this ride.Golden Zephyr     Fat friendly, short lines, so we went twice in a row. I could have been larger and still could have fit on this ride.At this point, I had to find out if the rumor was true     are Disney corn dogs the best ever? The Corn Dog Shack is in this area, so I went for it. They were very good; probably the best corn dog I   ve ever had (line is a bit slow).I got a Fast Pass for Goofy   s Flight School and went to the Little Mermaid ride.The Little Mermaid     Fat friendly, but this ride is exciting for 6 year old girls. If you are a 6 year old girl and 350 pounds, this ride is perfect for you. Line moves fast.Goofy   s Flight School     OK, finally a ride that is not fat friendly. I had to cross my legs to barely fit in the seat, but I was in pain the whole ride. My son, size 42 and 250 pounds fit in this ride OK. If you are bigger than a size 44 waist, run! My prediction: Pain!We have now officially completed the Paradise Pier area by 1pm! Now on to Pacific Wharf.The Bakery Tour     Video led tour with no height or weight limitations. Great if you like making bread.We could barely walk, but we had to see Aladdin at 2:30pm. So we went to Hollywood Land, grabbed a Fast Pass for the Tower of Terror and ran to Aladdin in the Hyperion Theater.Aladdin     Awesome show, only 50% full. Seats were big enough for me. This is a must see. Did I mention that this is an awesome show?!Tower of Terror     Hurray for Fast Passes! I only waited 10 minutes in line (instead of 40). This ride is fat friendly and people larger than me were able to fit on the ride. It was a little tight, but doable.Monsters Inc     40 minute line. Very fat friendly. I could fit just fine. The ride is nothing spectacular, but my feet hurt so bad, I was glad to sit down. It was after 4:30pm, so time to run to Radiator Springs to cash in our Fast Pass tickets we got the first thing in the morning.Radiator Springs Racers     I have never seen lines this long before. The estimated time in line was over 2 hours, but I had a Fast Pass, so only a 15 minute wait for me! This ride is fat friendly and people at least 50 pounds larger could fit on this ride. This is a fun ride too. This line was also 2 hours at the time the park closed at 10pm.Luigi   s Flying Tires     This was about a 25 minute wait. I fit on the tire, but my weight was too much and the tire wouldn   t move. When I laid back on the tire to center the weight, it finally moved, but it ends up going backwards. Nice ride, but my weight was an issue.It   s Tough Being a Bug     Fat friendly. Nice show with all of the special effects.We went to the animation studios and learned about animation. It was amazing, but we didn   t have time to do everything. Neat experience (and yes, it is fat friendly but very few chairs and my feet were killing me     self amputation was a temptation).It is now after 7:20pm and we had done all of the rides we wanted to go on. The family liked the roller coaster and the Toy Story ride the best, so back to Paradise Pier.We got a Fast Pass for the roller coaster and then waited in line for almost 1 hour for the Toy Story ride. The roller coaster closes early so we kept riding it until 8:45pm and then used our Fast Pass for the World of Color.World of Color     nice show, but very crowded. Standing room only (my poor feet). Lots of spraying water, lots of colorful lights, movie clips are shown on a  screen  of water. Way cool.After the show, the park was closing soon and my family was glad to leave. We were glad that we didn   t do Bear River Run because of our experience yesterday (it is no fun to walk around with wet feet, especially if you are fat!)I did get stopped at the end and was asked to take a survey. I told them I wasn   t interested, but they were persistent so I thought I would take their 3 minute survey. They led me to a special room where I answered questions on the computer. It took 15 minutes. I thought they might give me a hat or some souvenir, but nothing. Oh well. I am glad that I didn   t get a 3 day pass     it would have sent me to an early grave.So far the most part, Disney parks are fat friendly, except for a few rides. When I go to other amusement parks around the country, I cannot go on half of the rides because of size issues. You are safe with Disney.I hope this information helps you as you plan your Disney trip.","Disneyland_California"
33886346,3,"missing","United States","The recent  5 day pass for the price of 3  brought too many people to the parks! It appears the rides cannot handle the volume of guests during a promotion especially in Summer, it's busiest season. Within 24 hours there were 12 rides that we attempted to get on, that broke down resulting in a 45 minute to an hour longer wait time or the ride closed and we had to leave. It was so crowded that there was no room to walk. Our last evening, after a trip to Laguna Beach (which was beautiful) we rushed back to Disneyland and we never made it on any rides ( the  E ticket  rides that we wanted to go on) due to  technical difficulties . However, the next morning (Sunday) we used our Magic Morning (early admission) to Disneyland and went on 5 (Mountain) rides in one hour which made up for the night before. Thankful for that Sunday morning   the day we were going home   to be able to leave happy. Overall, I would say this was a very expensive trip to be somewhat disappointed at the Happiest Place on Earth. I still recommend Disneyland but not during Summer when there is a promotion. We usually have an excellent time at Disneyland and have never experienced any ride breaking before. This was a strange trip this year.","Disneyland_California"

Most of the rides are indoors so this did not have much of an impact. But there are a few outside which seem to keep going in the rain. I decided to brave the rain for a few of them and ended up a bit wet, but went to watch Lion King afterwards & dried out a little. The show was fantastic & has us singing Hakuna Matata. Unfortunately the rain did not stop in time for the night time parade & sadly it was cancelled. It did stop for the fireworks & this made our day. The park is a bit on a the expensive side and some of the attractions were closed due to maintenance. Other than that there was little to complain about.","Disneyland_HongKong"

296773351,4,"2015-8","Singapore","The rides were very evenly spread out and the park was quite big. We needed a 2 day pass to cover the whole theme park. The theme park had three added lands, Toy Story Land, Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Manor. Best ride! We felt that the Mine cars in Grizzly gulch was the best roller coaster we have ever rode as it was multi directional with many surprises in store for us. We went many times as my kids especially liked it. Scariest? Rides1.  Mystic manor . It wasn't very scary so don't worry about leaving your kids out. However, little ones should not ride this. This is a not to be missed ride as the cars move in a special way. You can also have some privacy as you can ride in it as a family of 4 just like Pooh's Hunny Hunt, another ride in Fantasy Land2.  RC Racer   The U shaped track in Toy Story Land Full of adrenaline pumping, this ride is worth a try. It gives you a feeling of your heart dropping when you reach the tops of the track and a lurching feeling as you zoom down. For thrill seekers and riders of all ages. Key fun rides For kids:1.  Space Mountain  in Tomorrowland (a must)A good ride that gives you the feeling of being in space. But may not be suitable for toddlers and infants as the ride starts dark at first with alien sounds that may scare them. 2.  Autopia  in Tomorrowland (a must) An interactive way to give your kids the experience of driving on the road the safe way. There are guiding tracks on the road to keep the electric car in a certain direction if the child doesn't know how to control the car. However, this ride often has a very long queue. 3.  Toy Soldier Parachute drop  in Toy Story Land (a must)Gives your kids the pleasant lurching feel of dropping down from the sky like soldiers with parachutes. A joy to ride but long queues ranging according to times of the day. We really enjoyed this one. 4.  Mad Hatter Tea Cups  in FantasylandA fun filling ride for families. There will be tea cups that spin around. Not encouraged for those with motion sickness. You can only increase the speed of the spinning cups by turning a circular  wheel  in the middle of the cup. Often requires short queuing times. (We only queued for 5 mins) however, you might feel extremely dizzy afterwards.  5.  The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh  in Fantasyland A cooling ride with strong winds. (The winds have something to do with the story) escape the hot weather by going in too. Fast pass is available there too! Very comfortable ride with soothing movements like  bouncing . Enjoyable for kids. 6.  It's a small world  (a must)A beautifully decorated castle with a soothing and mild boat ride inside. The longest ride in Hong Disneyland. It has many colourful animated figures with bright singing and lighting with different themes. Travels around the world. Suitable for all ages including infants. *** 7.  Jungle River Cruise  in Adventureland ***A little scary towards the end with loud explosions of fire and a frightening village. Not encouraged for most young children. (1 9 years)A very fun filling experience other than the extremely hot weather and long queuing times! A no.1 on the list of most families! ","Disneyland_HongKong"

156081834,5,"2013-1","United States","Being that we're on the east coast, people always ask why we prefer to go west rather than south for our Disney fix. Well, honestly, we went there for the first time in 2011 and fell in love with the quaintness of the original park. With younger children, Disneyland is not as intimidating as it's younger yet bigger brother in Florida. And yet, it has all the charm anyone could ever dream of as being part of a family vacation.I will say there was one big disappointment on our recent trip earlier this year. It was the first time we'd been back since 2011 and, I know this may sound silly, we were hoping that one of our favorite unlisted attractions would be there. Part of what made our first trip so special was an older man working at the bag check area and the front gates to the parks. His name was Michael and, I will tell you, he was incredible. Now all the people at Disney I understand are taught to be friendly and courteous. That's obvious. But this man, well, first off, it was like being in line with Rodney Dangerfield as he was talking with every guest and from what I could tell he was making them laugh. I didn't understand it until we reached the front and simply asked for directions. Well Michael went gave us extremely explicit directions to Downtown Disney which included circumnavigating the globe! And that was just the start. He did much more. When he found out it was our first trip, he gave our daughters 1st visit badges they still have and explained to them that they were about to enter the most magical place in the entire world. Honestly, my wife and I were in tears when he finished. It was the most precious moment and best of all, it was real. It wasn't made up or choreographed. For the rest of our trip, we made sure to check if he was working and waited in line even though others had no one waiting in their lines. It was obvious he had other fans. And he always had something new and clever and extremely funny to say. I just couldn't believe it. But after all, we were at Disneyland. I know I've gone on and on about this guy but I was told when we arrived for our past visit he had left Disneyland. Well we were a bit heartbroken. If you are out there Michael, please know that you made our first visit the most wonderful experience I think we may ever have as a family. Thank you. If those of you at Disneyland are reading this, please, get that guy back if you can. I know I speak for many.

Do some research and plan carefully to have the best time. This is true for any Disney park in the world, and especially important on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.I went on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. It was certainly open and busy. Going on Christmas Eve Day is do able but to make sure you have a great time, you have to do some forward planning and following some strategies. I preface this by saying it was just my husband and I, no children and we're 31 years old with prior experience in Disney Parks in America.1. If you can possibly afford to stay in the Kingdom Club level at Disneyland Hotel, it is worthwhile as they will give you front of the line passes for one show and one ride per person for each day you are in the Park. The first time we walked past 200 waiting people to go into the theatre first was when I realised it was worth every penny.2. Buy your tickets online or at the hotel to save time.3. Check out the park map and ride show descriptions on the website before you leave home and make a list of the  must sees . You will need two full days to see it all, especially if you have kids.4. It pays to get there at least 45 mins before the official park opening time (if you haven't bought your tickets) as Main Street will opening for shopping and bakery goods (and while we were there, they offered 15% off for all purchases bought before 10:00am, official opening time). If you are staying in either of the Disney hotels, the cashier can arrange for your purchases to be delivered to the hotel free of charge.5. 15 mins before the official park opening time, go to the rope drop at the Hub in front of the castle, carefully choosing the direction of the land you want to visit first. I strongly recommend Toy Story Land, followed by Grizzly Gulch, then Fantasyland.6. If it's important to you to have a proper sit down meal, make your reservation as soon as you enter the Park. To enjoy a meal in the hotel on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, you will have to book a month out at least (ASAP) and pay in full. No kidding. It's worth it.7. Research the proper use of FastPass before you go and use whenever you can   without this you will have a miserable time, I cannot say that strongly enough. This is particularly important if you are not staying on the Kingdom Club level. If you are staying with Kingdom Club, you can still get more time specific Fastpasses using your entry ticket.8. Do not miss any of the shows or parades or the fireworks, they are spectacular and some were even better than those at Disneyland California. I was blown away. For parades, you can show up 15 mins before for reasonable views unless you have children   you should arrive 30mins before if you want them to have good views or the potential to participate in the dance in the parade.9. Some rides offer  Single Rider  lines which makes the wait much quicker but you won't be able to ride with your friends family. Check the website to see which rides offer this.Those are my tips for Disneyland on Christmas Eve Christmas Day especially but you could probably use most of these on other busier days.Follow as many of those tips as you can and it will help you have a great time.For Disney Fans: I have been the California parks twice and Orlando once. I did four months of research using websites, blogs, forum posts and reviews before I went. I was prepared for the smallest park in the world with perhaps not much to do and maybe not as clean as other parks. I was pleasantly surprised.This was a very clean park and certainly had  the magic . The cast members were so friendly and gave out stickers to kids and Disney fans like me when they saw me collecting them.The Castle is small but that's okay. Toy Story Land will blow you away. Grizzly Gulch is an amazing ride. Like Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which halfway through the ride.... no I won't spoil it for you.The Golden Mickeys is fantastic. Watch the right hand side of the screen for the English translation.Make sure you see Stitch Encounter, it is a really fun show.Flights of Fantasy had some of the best floats and catchiest music I've ever seen. Disney in the Stars Fireworks will bring you to tears. Stand close enough to see the projections on the castle but far enough to have the fireworks frame the Castle.All the lands except Main Street will close straight after the Fireworks show and they will not let you re enter (roped off). So I recommend you go over two days to pace yourself and do everything.Main Street Corner Cafe is a nice escape from the crowds.Stay at the Disneyland Hotel to complete the magic.Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.Every Disney fan should go, but best in Winter. Summer would be too hot. Mystic Point opens next year and looks amazing.","Disneyland_HongKong"

Tremendous fireworks light show watched five times! parades lovely and the Frozen show and Mickey and the Magician shows were brilliant Ride highlights   Ratatouille and Hollywood Tower hotel in the studios and Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean and Haunted Mansion.Room for improvement?   no good coffee to be found in the park! Limited range of Fast food everywhere in the park   not great, overpriced and only warm at best.

Well organised entry into the park, proper security, immaculate grounds and clean facilities. The variety of rides was very good and suited my 8 year old who doesn't like the big roller coaster style rides and enjoys the magic of the Disney films and characters. We went to 3 of the shows and found them fun and professional, some of the standard of a West End show. It wasn't as busy as normal on the Tuesday we went, so queuing wasn't too bad.As expected all of the restaurants and cafe's were expensive and I felt there was way too many shops selling disney merchandise. Of course you need them there, but there were literally hundreds of shops selling it.A great day out, even though we ended up doing 23,000 steps in one day!","Disneyland_Paris"

The biggest downer for us though was that the characters were not out and about in the park at all which was really disappointing. The parade was great and the characters lit the Christmas tree which was really special. We didn't stay for the fireworks because it was already  4!

Watched the parade, took some rides, have some snacks and watched the fireworks display.We stayed at the Disney Hollywood hotel and day two started earlier at 10 am plus. We took almost all the rides except one which our son did not meet the height requirement. For the rides we enjoyed, we queue and took a second time. Average queue time is 30 45 mins on a weekday in June. Our only complaint would be the temperature! It's a whopping 33degrees Celsius in June and there is not many area with shelters especially if your are walking from one zone to another. Drinks and ice Popsicle is great but is not cheap!

We enjoyed there every second of the time we spent there. Not only your children, you will not like to come back from Disneyland. Everything is made there is to mesmerise you. Starting from the toy train to meeting the ICONIC Mickey mouse. You can   t forget a single second of your time spent here.Disneyland is divided in 7 sections. In which only two sections have rides, in which fantasyland is for young children and tomorrowland is for adults and teens.Other than rides, you will see, ironman museum with an awesome 7D show. Another 7D show is about Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.   it   s an small world    ride in a boat is simply the most charming. Well I will not say much about other attractions, but all are equally awesome. Park is super clean and well maintained. You won   t find anything which looked dirty or worn out. Staff is very supportive. When we were there HALLOWEEN was around corners, so the whole park was decorated with Halloween theme. Entry fee has just right price tag but rest everything inside is so costly. A half litre water bottle costed 35 HKD. A mickey shaped lighting balloon costs HKD 150. Logically this balloon should cost less than 15 HKD (150INR) in India. Other than attractions, you can also shop there extensively, from a basic T shirt to a great party wear gown, a simple water bottle to soft toys, everything related to Disney is there for sale. Prices are obviously so high. A basic T shirt for 2 yr child was priced for 200 HKD (2000 INR). A doll set of 24 small dolls set back me 400 HKD(4000INR). I have not visited other Disneylands, but this one is so mesmerising that your brain will refuse to forget the instances of Disneyland.

But please be sure to enquire the hotel staff for the view. There's also many shops inside selling many souvenirs which is what I like the most about! However, you can't bring certain things inside such as beer etc etc. (They will check your bag before you can make your entrance, which is a bit troublesome.)

546321081,5,"2017-12","Hong Kong","If you   ve never been to a Disneyland this is a good introduction to what Disney has to offer. If you   ve been to Disney in any other country, consider this a miniature, manageable one day version of it. The attention to details are to be admired. A lot of rides and attractions are localised, especially the Ironman Experience (which replaced the Buzz Lightyear ride). Most narration is in English, Cantonese and Putonghua, with some being in Cantonese only (Animation Academy). The Mickey Wonderous Book Show was all in Cantonese except the singing parts. However there are subtitles and it doesn   t really take away from understanding of the the graphics show. The restaurants are nothing special. The quality of food is below par and are overpriced. When we went three of the main restaurants were closed so food choice was limited. Luckily we were staying in the hotel so we had that option instead. I didn   t see any drinking water stations. We went on Saturday and Sunday. We ended up not needing the fast pass. Lines were 30 mins max. The lines which were 50mins plus we skipped until later in the evening. If you get to the park as soon as it opens, you can fit in most of the rides before noon. Late afternoon was when it got crazy busy. The evening parade was spectacular. Very impressive. The fireworks were impressive as they are much lower than most firework displays so it was extremely bright. The accompanying music was what made it extra special. And the fake snow comes on right after which was fun. ","Disneyland_HongKong"

I'd heard all of the jokes about how terrible it is   so our expectations weren't high. We had a nice time. My biggest complaint is the number of rides that weren't working or were being refurbished (Teacups, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Manor and several others I wasn't familiar with from the Orlando Park). There was also a general lack of customer satisfaction or  hustle  to get people through lines and onto rides quickly. Also disappointed with the photopass. I'm normally a sucker for the photopass at Disney or Universal. This one was $79, but there are only 6 rides that take photos and two of them are closed. Maybe it's worth it if you do a Princess breakfast.

It was busy but manageable, but most rides were 30 45 minute queues. We purchased a 4 day ticket to cover Disneyland Park, Studios and Village   the deal was 4 days for the price of 3. This review is for the Park only   I have posted a separate review for the Studios.Recommended time   this is a big Park, with lots of attractions so allow 2 days for your visit (not including the studios).Entrance   there are usually queues to get through the bag search area. They seemed to be looking for food but I did manage to sneak a few rolls in each day   I think food id ok provided it constitutes a snack and not a picnic.Food and drink   very, very expensive and, unless you eat in a proper (and even pricier) restaurant, you are generally stuck with fast food of very ordinary quality. Probably worth trying the Disney Village (near main entrance and railway station) for food. Places like Buffalo Bills, Planet Hollywood and even McDonalds for Big Mac fansAttractions   plan your visit and definitely use the Fastpass (FP) facility   you will save hours!! I have reviewed the attractions we went on   but others such as Indiana Jones (FP) and Space Mountain (FP) are highly recommended but have height restrictions.Adventureland: Daughter not too interested in this land except for her favourite ride which we went on 3 times  Pirates of the Caribbean   very, very impressive. A boat ride through a vast and cavernous Pirate land. Mainly sedate with two small water slides which will appease the kids. The real artistry is in the attention to detail of the characters and scenery. Even the walk down to the start of the ride is worth the admissionFronteirland:Phantom Manor   Haunted house style ride. Very ambient and not at all scary. Bit of a let down in the department but, again, the attention to detail is fantastic and there is enough to keep the kids occupied. Thrill seekers will have to make do with a more sedate paceBig Thunder Mountain (FP)   edge of your seat stuff. Very fast ride which initially goes through an underwater tunnel to an island in the middle of a lake. Hold on tight   very good. My 6 year old enjoyed it but was relieved to get off!Fantasyland:Peter Pan's Flight (FP)   rated as a 'must see' in the DLP program, but we were both left disappointed. Thankfully FP meant a short wait in the queue. A slow and jolt laden ride which had the feeling of being aged and perhaps in need of an update. Wouldn't have been disappointed to miss it but probably one of those things you have to do.Dumbo the flying elephant   a fun ride going round and round and up and down in Dumbo shaped cars. Good for younger visitors and very similar to Orbitron.Mad Hatter's Tea Cups   again one for the younger children but still good fun getting dizzy going round and round in a tea cupIt's a Small World    a boat ride through the world's many countries and cultures. My daughter enjoyed being in the boat and listening to the music. I really appreciated the intricacies of the characters and scenes   very impressiveCasey Jr & Le Pays de Contes Fees   unfortunately we left it too late to get on these rides although both looked good from a distance and are listed as 'not to be missed'Discoveryland:Orbitron   as per Dumbo ride except in space rockets. OkBuzz Lightyear Laser Blast (FP)   much talked about and perhaps slightly disappointing given the hype. Good fun all the same. Traveling through 'space' and shooting at targets on 'enemies'. Your score tots up on the front of your car so you can have a competition with your friends or family on the way round. Whilst perhaps not living up to expectations, it is certainly well put together....and who doesn't love a shoot out?Star Tours (FP)   spacecraft simulator which, given the huge number of simulators around nowadays, feels very dated. If you get the opportunity to visit the Explorers Hotel, make sure to go on the 6 D simulator which is 10 times betterLes Mysteres de Nautilis   walkthrough Captain Nemo's submarine. Thankfully no queues, but for a reason. Well put together but held no interest at all for my daughter. Through in less than 2 mins.Autopia   drive a 1950's car round a race track.

There are stops in each land with the main station being at the top of main street. However there can be long queues.Characters' Parade   circa 5.30pm daily. Fantastic opportunity to see all your favourite characters sing and dance their way past the Castle and through Main St. Secure your vantage point early. I can recommend just outside Pizzeria Bella Notte from about 5pm.Disney Castle Light Show   circa 10pm daily. Absolutely spectacular and definitely not to be missed. Very, very clever animation and music as you would expect. We saw it 3 nights running and, despite having to deal with the carnage that is catching a bus when leaving with the masses, my daughter insisted on staying to watch. To get a good view you need to be in position about an hour early. Best place to sit is at the roundabout at the end of Main St   if you are happy to sit and wait for an hour. Do not miss!Ok that's it for the Park   please also see my Studios review as they are definitely worth a visit.","Disneyland_Paris"

Next I got a FastPass for the first ride I wanted and continued to use them throughout the day to go on all the rides I wanted and even ride them multiple times (like Space Mountain). The park is so open and walkable that you can definitely cover it all in a day. Even when something was down for quick maintenance, it would reopen quickly and then you could get on it with basically no line. Very few parts were closed, which was good.

106896552,2,"2011-4","United Kingdom","If you've never been to a Disney Park and are thinking about your first visit then don't read on. However   if you've previously been to the parks in America and you've now been to the park in Paris, I imagine you may nod your head reading this.This place shouldn't really be called 'Disneyland Paris'. If they were being accurate when naming this it should be called 'Theme Park based on the one in Orlando   but run by the French'.Having been to the parks in Orlando on a couple of occasions it has to be said this park is a very poor relation   the black sheep of the family.My wife, 6 year old son and I stayed for 3 nights 4 days over the recent Bank Holiday weekend and to be honest I was disappointed. Where to Start?Staying at a Disney Hotel 'entitles' you to additional 'Magic' hours in the parks   although it is only for the Magic Kingdom and not the Studios. The extra hours are a waste of time. On our first day there we got to the park at just after 0900   1 hour into the extra hours   and nothing was open or operating!! There was nowhere open to get a coffee, no shops open to part with your cash and the only areas you could get to were Main Street and Fantasyland   all the other areas were roped off with a glum looking 'Cast Member' stood there stopping anyone from exploring. Even though you could get into Fantasyland (the other side of the castle) no rides operated until shortly before 1000   WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!! Certainly not what happens in Orlando.The quality of the rides was generally poor. Some of the rides that you sit on a train for and go on a journey (as were all rides) were over in less than 60 second (the Carousel in Fantasyland only goes around twice before it stops and you have to get off!!) There was little attention to detail in some of the rides. The scenery on all of the indoor rides seemed to stop at eye level   when you looked up all you could see were ceiling panels   which weren   t always there. Also despite the parks opening to everyone at 1000 a lot of the shows in the parks (Cinemagique etc) don't have their first showing until 1200. Something we couldn't understand.The attitude of the 'cast members' wasn't particularly enthusiastic either. On the first evening we tried to get a table at the restaurant in Frontierland at a few minutes past 2000 (the park closes at 2100)   we tried this one because every other eatery in the park was already closed   despite the restaurant only being at best a third full we were told in no uncertain terms that they were not serving anyone else tonight. Aslo the staff are in no hurry to serve you either. We stopped for some ice cream at the ice cream parlour on Main Street. When we began queuing, there was 1 person in front of us. 15minutes later when they had served that 1 person with 3 scoops of ice cream   there was a queue out the door   something that was to be a regular occurrence.There is no two ways about it   the parks are incredibly expensive for food and souvenirs. When in the Magic Kingdom we stopped at Casey   s at the top of Main Street for a quick bite. I had a cheesey hot dog with soft drink (no souvenir cup) and it cost   8.00   it certainly was not worth it. Among some of the souvenirs we looked at we wanted some photo frames for some of the pictures we had. A plain wooden frame   with tiny Mickey Mouse ears embossed in each corner for a 6  x 4  photo was 15 Euros!!! I always expect theme parks to be a bit more expensive   but the cost of things here is ridiculously high   at least Dick Turpin wore a mask!!!Although you wouldn't call the place unclean, it is certainly nowhere near as clean as it's counterpart in Orlando. It's not uncommon to find black sticky marks over the pavements where drinks have been spilt days previously and nothing been done.Also the park tolerates 'Street Merchants' hassling customers just outside the park entrance. Several times men offering Caricatures for a price tried to make a move towards our son to get him to go over. Plus in the evening there were vendors who laid out a small towel and were selling very cheap and tacky souvenirs   none of it Disney related. Not sure this would have been tolerated in Orlando!!That said, if (like I do) you have a wife and child that are mad for Disney then it is worth a quick visit (provided you have deep pockets!!) to let them get a 'fix' of the Disney Magic!!","Disneyland_Paris"

We got the train from Paris (very easy) and arrived half an hour before opening time, only to find that we could get straight in! We scanned our tickets and found ourselves in Main Street USA. The other lands were closed off until 10am, so we had a look in some of the souvenir shops, got some great photos before there were too many people around, then lined up to get into Frontierland. Some words of advice: don't jump straight in a line for one of the big rides. Instead, get a FastPass for one (free at most of the popular rides) and go and do something else. We had time to do the Phantom Manor and Pirates of the Caribbean, then returned at 11am and got straight on Thunder Mountain while other people were still lining up from opening time. This set the tone for the whole day, as we used the FastPasses a number of times and had very little wait time at the other rides. We had been on all major rides by mid afternoon, which included a stop for lunch, then went on some of them again. This really made the day so much more enjoyable. Even though it was busy, the weather wasn't great so there mustn't have been as many people there as usual. Our one disappointment for the day was the lack of characters walking around. Other than a couple of set times (one for Baloo and King Louie, the other for Rapunzel) we saw no characters until the parade at the end of the day. This was a bit of a shame, and I imagine even more so for all the kids there. Other than that, we had a wonderful day. Yes the food is expensive, but what do you expect at a theme park!

We did the 3 day park hopper pass. The tickets are pricey which is one of the few cons. Our favorite rides are still Thunder Mountain, Matterhorn and Indiana Jones. I recommend getting the fast pass for these. We saw and engaged with way more characters than we expected. If you get 3 day pass then you get one  Magic Morning  which means you are allowed to enter the park 1 hour early. But beware that you can only do that on certain days of the week so plan accordingly! It was on the Magic Morning that we got in 1 hour early and saw a bunch of characters with little to no wait. As you can imagine, eating in the park is fairly expensive but I saw lots of people bring in their own foods and snacks. Next time I will probably pack protein bars and snacks and then maybe just eat dinner in the park.

We are 3 adults (56, 55 & 22).We have never been to Disneyland anywhere so have nothing to compare the Hong Kong with. It was wonderful!As my family didn't want too early a start we set off from Causeway Bay by MTR, changed trains at Sunny Bay onto the wonderful Mickey train. How beautiful this is, arriving around Midday.The Station at Disneyland is beautiful and the sights including the fountain out front entice you into the park.We did not have to queue for tickets & it worked out about $40AUD for each of, unheard of at home. We also found the food, sourvenirs and everything else inside very reasonable.It turned out that the time available wasn't enough for us to see everything. The park closes earlier in January with the fireworks at 7pm.We had lots of photos taken with the characters in Fantasyland and we were surprised that they also took photos with our cameras, no pressure to buy theirs (we did anyway). Once again no queueing.The two shows, Golden Mickeys & Festival of the lion king were truely wonderful and also the grand parade. Each lasted around 30 minutes. It was very funny to us hearing Mickey speak in Chinese! The performers in the grand parade really turned in a wonderful performance, so professional and trying to get the crowd involved.Lunch was very nice and reasonably priced in Fantasyland. We also had nice coffee and cake in Main Street.We went on the railway and the jungle river cruise and that is about all we had time for. We saw all of fantasy land, but only a little of Tomorrow Land and Adventure Land. The fireworks were truely spectacular! We were dreading how crowded the train would be back to Causeway Bay, but it was near empty by the time we had bought our souvenirs, which I wish I had bought more of. Everything sounds so expensive in HKD, but when you work it out they are very reasonable divided by 6.5 for us.I can't wait to go back   I have read so many reports on here how small it is and you don't need much time here but we could have done with another half a day at least to see everything.The park itself is clean and well maintained, also the toilets. Perhaps we were lucky with the small number of people there the day we went but it was very comfortable getting around and no queueing for anything, not even the jungle cruise.I can't give anything but praise for our experience. Perhaps if I wish hard enough I will be back again soon. We loved Hong Kong (our first visit) and will definately return.","Disneyland_HongKong"

The place it`s very scenographic and there are some stunning attractions (don`t miss  it`s a small world  and  pirates of the Caribbean ). The queues are a bit annoying but some can be jumped taking a  fastpass  ticket that pratically books you at a specific time. To be honest I expected to find more  characters  going around. By night the view is spectacular and don`t go away before watching the show of lights and fountains around the castle. Getting there is very easy by RER and it won`t take more than forty minutes from the centre of Paris.","Disneyland_Paris"

616413011,3,"2018-8","United States","We visited here with a 2 day 2 park pass in August whilst staying at Eurocamp at Vic Sur Aisne. Slightly reduced price as purchased through Picniq website before hand. You have to see Disney to experience the charm etc. My girls are 10 and 13 years too old for princesses but too young (it would seem) for big rides. We basically spent all day queuing. The shortest queue was 60 minutes for a 3 minute ride! If you have older kids I would highly recommend big thunder mountain. We also went on Peter pan (1hr 20 min queue), Buzz lightyear laser (1hr 15 min) and around Alice's curious labyrinth but TBH the queues were not worth it   probably magical though with younger ones. The Fast Pass system is not what it is sold to be personally speaking. We got there as soon as it opened and the first pass we got was for 12.30 pm. You have to use that prior to obtaining the next one, by that time the next pass was for 5.30 pm! The food is extortionate and not a lot of what the kids would like unless you sit down at one of the main restaurants. We took a bag with us on the second day and crammed it with food and drinks   mainly to save time by eating whilst queuing and also so we knew there would be something they would eat!I sound a bit like a party pooper and i do love Disney but i won't be returning i'm afraid.","Disneyland_Paris"

The rides are truly brilliant, space mountain and splash mountain were our favourites. We got a park hopper for the day and easily covered both parks on a weekday in early May. The atmosphere is amazing and even a 3 hour downpour of heavy rain couldn't dampen our spirits!

182790523,5,"2013-10","Netherlands","Although there are two parks in Paris, this is of course the main park that is attractive for people of all ages. From 'it's a small world' for the very little ones to attractions like Space Mountain for the older ones. The park is well maintained and the staff is very friendly and helpful. It is the typical quality that you can always expect from Disney Theme Parks.Be however prepared that the Park is quite large and you will have to walk long distances that will be very tiring for the younger children. I have seen this cause a lot of stress by parents so my advice is to prepare well and only target the attractions that you like best.On top of that, most of the major attractions have a systems called Fastpass where you can get tickets upfront to return at a set point in time to avoid the longer queues. This can be very helpful so study that upfront as well (it is not that difficult). The previous two advises are especially useful on busy days (which is basically all holidays and weekends). Disney also lowers the capacity of the rides on the less busy days so there are almost always waiting times at the most popular attractions.The Entrance fee is expensive and most of the food in the restaurants is also slightly on the expensive side. There is however a large variety of restaurants and my advise is to be there early on busy days.","Disneyland_Paris"

A lot of the rides were being overhauled which I can understand and appreciate. All the restaurants served pretty much all the same 3 items. Disney studios was not that great at all. The back lot tour was a joke. The merchandise that was available was not the great, just a very poor selection to choose from. The employee's even said they were years behind from the other Disney parks. It just seemed to me that Disney half assed this park. I'm glad I went but would never go again","Disneyland_Paris"

We found some of the queues were in excess of 60 minutes on average but as it was half term it would be expected. We found it better to visit Hollywood Studios first as it was much quicker to have our etickets validated and exchanged for Disney passes.Security is very good,checking bags on entry. We could hop from one park to the other. We found that fast passes ran out very quickly,usually around 11am on popular rides. Quite a few rides did not have fast pass facility however. Some had single rider options which helps cut the waiting time,so worth doing,same experience just not together. Can't comment on the food available as we brought our own lunch and preferred to dine around our hotel,cheaper than Disneyland. Val D'europe is a great place to stock up if self catering onsite.

Thus, a nicer meal is more expensive than a poorer quality one. You can get a pizza, salad, fruit and drink for about $15, but the quality isn't great. Conversely, you can get some fantastic food in Blue Lagoon (review elsewhere), but comes at a much higher price.We only had to queue for longer than 20 minutes once in our whole weekend there, and that was to meet the Disney princesses. Obligatory for 6 year old girls. Two hours wait was absolutely worth it though, to see my little one's face SHINING with joy.Over the weekend a number of the rides (like Snow White and Pirates of the Carribean) were closed with technical difficulties, often only right at the very last minute after we'd been queueing for 20 minutes. This was annoying   why is there no comms between the people running the rides and the general info guys in the park?You expect to pay a lot of money there, you expect to stand in queues and if you're not expecting that, you've not done your reading up.

582096497,4,"2018-5","United States","I   ve been to Disney World when I was a child a long time ago but husband had not and wanted to experience    magic    for himself. I chose one day park hopper tickets on a value day as well as the extra money for the MaxPass , hoping it would not be crowded. But it seemed like everyone had the same idea. I   ve never seen so many people before. It took about 15 minutes in line to even get through the security gate and then we stood there overwhelmed. There is no clear signs about where to enter either park or workers to ask questions. When we did figure at the entrance, there were longer lines to enter there too. I recommend you download the Disneyland App and plot out a plan on how to cover the park. The fast pass is a slightly good concept. You still have to wait in line a significant amount of time to get the pass as well the ride once you do. I had to find a worker which was difficult, to show me how to do the MAXPASS on my phone. It   s is convenient to make ride selections on your phone but I did not like that you couldn   t make multiple choices even if another ride was at a later time. Had to wait about an hour between each selection. But I still think it   s worth it if you plan on going on the major rides. Learned later that you could use the Fast pass anytime between the timeframe given. Like any amusement park, the food and souvenirs are overpriced, but here maybe a little more than needed. The park can be accomplished in about 2 days so I   m not sure about getting passes longer than that. For the park hopper I comment in another review I made about the California Adventure Park, but looking back if you want to do that park too then a 3 day pass. From about 10 6pm we were able to do the rides It   s a Small World, Star Wars Tour ride, Indiana Jones, Jungle Safari boat and Soaring. We also ride the monorail, ate at buffet restaurant in New Orleans theme area and snack food a a few areas throughout. Did some brief shopping at a few stores and saw some shows parades on the streets. By then, we were done. We didn   t want to stand in a long time in line for another 7 minute ride and we met some family and friends in Downtown Disney for dinner. Overall, we got enough of the experience we wanted in a one day pass. ","Disneyland_California"

When your in the entry queue to the park, the multiple lines can be quite long. Sometimes placing you in the hot sun for awhile. One thing I have noticed that causes the slow up is people that are entering for the first time and need to have vouchers, new tickets and the like validated and having to have their picture taken which can take some time to do. I think this is a bit unfair to those that have completed this process already. There are many unopened kiosks that could be used to do this process before you go through the turnstiles freeing up the time that the agents need to do this and making entry much smoother and quicker. If Disneyland reads this they could make this place even happier!","Disneyland_California"

IDisney really needs to do some crowd control, but we know they are all about the money, so they won't do anything. It was just crazy. Plus there are so many rides closed for refurbishment! We did our homework before hand and knew what rides would be closed, but decided it would be worth going if it's slower. What were we thinking?! Also, so many rides broke down while we were there, in line for them the Matterhorn, thunder mountain, Indiana, and wild toad. This on top of the already closed rides made our trip ridiculous. Also, the magic morning entry was totally horrible. Thousands upon thousands of people and they only open fantasyland and tomorrow land? That hour was the worst time to be at Disneyland and so not worth it. Overall, we did the best we could with what it was and had fun, but for the thousands of dollars we spent on this vacation, I wish we would have spent our money somewhere else.

Hotel is huge and large number of people checking in the staff were efficient and friendly. The hotel had a refurbishment and looked lovely. This was our 5th visit to Disney and it didn't disappoint. However we did feel that some of the changes made it less magical. Usually OTT decorations seemed toned down for Halloween. Loads of characters around the park seemed an improvement on last visit. If you have a meal plan booking is essential! Luckily we got into the buffet at the grange in the village but we qued 45 minutes before it opened on the first night. After that we tried to book plasa gardens but was full both days. Walked up to agrahbar buffet to be told it was full. Ended up eating at the cowboy cookout which was lovely but you don't get the value of the vouchers.

We stayed off sight this time which was good. When we drove in we didn't park in the main car park (I do think 15 euros is a ripoff just to park your car) but parked at the station   worked out a bit cheaper and if youre not planning on staying the full day could be fair bit cheaper. It's also closer to walk to the parks too. We used to bring in some sandwiches and snacks each day   although they searched your bags they didn't mind. A lot of people did this and as long as you didn't sit in the cafes and restaurants eating your sandwiches they didn't seem to mind. We also kept water and coke in the freezer at our accommodation and this defrosted during the day but meant we had a good supply of ice cold water and coke.We spent a total of 2 days in the park and although both bank holidays in France did everything except Dumbo. Made good use of fastpass and the staff were very organised at getting people on and off the rides to keep the queues moving often quicker than the wait times. Staff very friendly and attentive, rides still great and pleanty of characters milling around for photos. Souvenirs and food generally expensive but there are some things to buy which aren't too badly priced but most toys you'll find cheaper in the Disney Store in the UK.

161260842,5,"2013-5","United Kingdom","My Boyfriend and I (in our 20s) visited Disneyland Paris to celebrate a special occasion. Even though we are not children anymore, we absolutely loved every second of our Disney experience, which suffices to say that Disneyland is perfect for any age. There is so much to see and do, and we were amazed at how much detail goes in to the park, there was always an amazing photo opportunity close by. We visited Disneyland between 12 16th of May and the first two days were relatively quiet (to our surprise) but the remaining three days were noticeably busier. The Sunday and The Monday, we managed to get on most rides near enough straight away with only a 5 or so minute wait. Although busier  the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday weren't too bad, the longest we waited for a ride was 25 minutes, which we were very happy with. To take full advantage of the attractions in this park, I highly recommend using fast passes where available, they will cut your waiting time in half, and will save you a lot of energy. Also, use your easy pass to gain entry to the Magic Kingdom from 8am. Those who stay in Disney Hotels are entitled to two 'extra magic hours' in the park before it officially opens at 10am. Doing this will allow you to experience the park in a quieter and more relaxed environment   and will also enable you to ride more of the attractions without the queuing. We rode Space Mountain during the 'Extra Magic Hours' and didn't have to queue at all, fantastic!The Park itself is well laid out and divided in to lands. There was something to enjoy for all ages in each of the lands and each contain notable attractions things to do. MAIN STREETCatch the parades here! The main parade is at 7pm every evening and I would advise you to arrive there early in order to maintain a good view. The 20th Celebration Train also resides there every hour from 1 4 daily. You'll be able to catch a glimpse of some characters such as Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and others. There are lots of shops in Main Street and also a few cake shops and cafes. This part of the park is also home to CITY HALL and here, you can book reservations for lunch and Dinner if you haven't already done so at your hotel. We found the staff in here to be very helpful and friendly.FANTASYLANDThis area of the park is mainly themed around fairy tales. The main attraction is Sleeping Beauty's castle   which we thoroughly enjoyed. It is so beautiful inside and out and should not be missed, don't forget to catch the sleeping Dragon beneath the castle! Other attractions we really enjoyed was Alice's Curious Labyrinth and It's a Small World. There's lots of things to do for little ones too, such as Dumbo's flight and the Tea Cups. Also, don't forget there is a chance to meet Disney Princesses and Mickey at specific places in the park (meet and greets)DISCOVERYLANDWe loved this area of the park as it is home to Space Mountain   one of our favourite rides. The land is mainly space themed and includes some great attractions. Buzz Lightyear's Lazer blast and Star Tours are not to be missed!ADVENTURELAND We really enjoyed this land. there are lots of things to see and do and lots of photo opportunities such as The Pirate ship and Tarzan's tree house. The Indiana Jones' Temple of Peril ride resides here, and if you are a thrill seeker you will certainly enjoy it! The Pirates of the Caribbean ride should also not be missed, it was lots of fun! The Blue Lagoon restaurant is also situated next door to the Pirates of the Caribbean and I would definitely recommend a meal here, it was gorgeous, one of our favourite places to eat in Disneyland!FRONTIERLANDWe loved the atmosphere in this land! It had a wild west Cowboy and Indian style theme running throughout and every detail from the buildings to the attractions was fantastic! We loved Big Thunder Mountain and the Phantom Manor and we enjoyed a short cruise around the land aboard the Mesa Riverboat! We also ate in a restaurant called The Lucky Nugget Saloon and we are very glad we did! It was a good meal, and the cheapest of our stay! Don't forget to stay in the Park until closing time to catch the amazing 'Disney Dreams' show! I recommend getting to the castle a little earlier in order to secure a good spot. The show itself was spectacular and we couldn't believe what they did with the castle, it really was breath taking! Lights, water projection, music, fireworks, it was just beautiful. Characters wander around the park at various times of the day but whether you get a picture with them, or their autograph really is hit and miss! They are bombarded with crowds and getting to the front is a mission and a half. We managed to meet a few of the characters but only did so by luck! Be aware, lots of people push their way to the front and will happily push anyone out of their way to meet a character   especially the most popular ones such as Donald, Daisy, Pluto etc!Food and drink in the Disneyland Parks are very expensive and we were aware of this before we visited, so we ensured we took plenty of money and we were happy to pay the prices because it is not everyday we get to visit Disneyland Paris and because we were celebrating a special occasion, we decided to treat ourselves!We had such an amazing time, and we will definitely return, hopefully around Halloween or Christmas when they decorate the parks! We're already looking forward to it! :)","Disneyland_Paris"

Unfortunately it appears Mickey runs on an extremely tight schedule. Every time we queued up to catch a glimpse, we were told in an extremely curt manner that Mickey was on a break or that the queue was now closed. In a park as big as this, could they risk two Mickey characters wandering around, so as not to disappoint the many children who have come to see him? If you adore shopping for Disney themed souvenirs, then this is the place for you. The whole park has been set up, almost exclusively, to do this alone.

I was told as a disabled person I could secure a 10% discount for myself, a free carer ticket and the children would be full price and we would get queue assistance. All this seemed very fair and generous but I was told we would need to buy the tickets at the park to secure this discount and access card. When I asked how to buy the tickets they said we needed to go to the Donald Desk on arrival! I suggest this should be re named the 'Donald Desk of Doom!' Pre trip I asked if I could reserve a chair for the day    No sorry, all our chairs are on a first come first served basis.  (was the response!) I couldn't take this risk so we bought one in a charity shop and took it with us. On the day we arrived at the Donald Desk, queued for 30 mins only to be told we were in the wrong queue! Apparently, we were in the service queue NOT the disabled queue! We then queued for another 30 mins in another queue which we were told was the right queue... only to be told they could not sell us the actual tickets only provide the access pass and we would need to join another queue to buy our tickets! There were only three queues to choose from all with 100's waiting,..... there were 20 desks unstaffed, we had to queue at one of the three desks for a further hour to buy 400 Euro's worth of tickets... we had arrived at the park at 10am .... if the signage had been better and the staff more helpful we could of started in the right queue... my children were in tears.... my son called it the queue of doom and said lets just go to lego land next time mummy.... There were families with autistic kids who didn't understand why we were not being allowed in the park... it was a truly miserable experience for everyone ...Once we were in the park the system worked well but the purchasing of the tickets was rude, disorganised and ridiculous.... We arrived at the park at 10 and didn't get on a ride until 12.15.... that's utterly crazy.... They should allow disabled guests to pre purchase tickets to reduce the wait or open more desks at busy times.","Disneyland_Paris"

150170549,5,"2012-12","United Kingdom","Myself, my wife and 2 teenage children spent a couple of days in Disneyland in late December 2012, including New Years Eve. I had purchased the tickets for a 2 day, 2 park trip fromTravel Republic for about   380 for all of us. They send you vouchers in the post and then you change them at the park. Painless! Anyhow, back to the park! Upon going through the main gates we were greeted with a Xmas parade and imitation snow on Main Street, which had thousands of people watching it. All the main Disney characters were on it and lots of performers all dancing about to Disney tunes. Got to say the sound system in both Parks is excellent and at no point does the sound fade away as you walk along. The Disney Castle is very impressive and is obviously the main focal point, as the excellent Disney Dreams Show is projected onto here in the evening. We went on a few rides including an hour long queueing session to get on Space Mountain2. It was worth it though, if you like Roller Coasters in the pitch black, with planets hurtling past you, and then going at high speed down a black hole. Dont go on it if you have a bad neck though, or you'll probably end up in casualty! After this ride we discovered that you could fast track the queueing system by putting your entrance ticket underneath the scanner, near to the rides. You then got a ticket with a time on and 'hey presto' no more queues!! Other rides included 'Pirates of the Caribbean' river ride. That was ok. (Well the wife liked it!) Also an Indiana Jones roller coaster ride. I enjoyed that one, as did the kids. Unfortunately the ride I really wanted to go on, 'Thunder Mountain' kept breaking down so we missed out on that one.Eating in the park is expensive, so we made sandwiches and took other food that we purchased from the enormous shopping mall in Val d'Europe, which is just one stop up the line from Disneyland. We did however eat at a burger place and some sort of Cowboy barn place at tea time The burger place (think it was in the Studios park) was expensive and not very good. The barn place we ate at on New Years Eve, and that was ok and reasonably priced! Certainly in comparison to the burger place we had eaten at previously! I had a bottle of Heineken in there and it cost me about 7 euros. No good for alcoholics this place!I am not very good at describing the parades but suffice to say they are excellent, and you won't be disappointed. As was the New years eve firework display.We also visited the Studios park. This is smaller than the Disneyland Park, but worth a visit. We took the tram tour around the film set, which was worth going on as they re enact an explosion and pour about 215000 litres of water over the tram. We didn't get wet though. Luckily as the weather was cold even though it was sunny. We also saw a stunt show in the Studios park, which takes place in front of a large tiered seated area, like a stand at a football ground. This was very good with car crashes, motorbike stunts, a rider getting set on fire and then they show you how it is all edited together as for a film. This show is well worth a visit.All in all we loved it at Disney, although it is very expensive its worth going to and brings out the big kid in you. If you want to visit Paris as well, it is only a 40 minute journey by train from the station just outside Disneyland. There is also a decent shop at this station selling sandwiches, in case you dont want to make your own for your Disney trip.This visit we stayed at Disneydreams hotel which meant being bussed in and out on a bendy bus. Next time we will stay at a hotel on site so that we can just walk in, and our entrance fee will be included.","Disneyland_Paris"

We had the Disney dining plan which I loved but again with this plan ahead so you know where you can use them as its a bit limited in the studios park.

On the lamp posts that line Mainstreet USA are birthday hats hanging upside down and filled with flowers. Also on Mainstreet there is an enourmous birthday invitation and Mickey Mouse shaped ballons.

208164515,2,"2014-5","Australia","Having experienced   and enjoyed   the original Disneyland in Anaheim (and Disney's California Adventure), we decided to add three days onto our European holiday to take our three young children (age 7, 7 and 9) to Disneyland Paris: we now wish we hadn't.It's not that it's terrible   it isn't   it just isn't as Disney would have you believe. The most disappointing aspect was the staff ('cast members'). Where in LA you get the perky, bubbly friendly service   from everyone   that you expect, at Disneyland Paris it felt as if the cast members were there under duress and would rather be somewhere else. There was no sparkle in the eye, no 'going that extra mile'   in fact, most of them were unhelpful at best, or downright rude at worst. Whether we were queuing to get a crepe or for a ride, the cast member we were finally met by rarely managed a smile   even our kids noticed. You can't pitch yourself as 'the happiest place on earth', then have your whole team getting around like the cast of Les Miserable.All the rides we went on were the usual Disney standard   clever animatronics, enchanting, fun etc. No complaints there: except for the ones that regularly stopped in motion   the Buzz Lightyear ride stopped six times while we were on it (that's six times during one ride!). We understand that big parks like this have long queues   we were prepared to wait   but when you saw half empty wagons being sent off, because the cast members weren't doing their jobs to fill the empty seats   it became infuriating. Frankly, the whole place felt mismanaged.Perhaps it was not yet peak tourist season (we went in late May), but to see so many restaurants and food outlets closed made the place look like it was abandoned in part (Frontierland and parts of Adventureland in particular). This, of course, meant the queues at the operating food outlets extended for miles.By the end of our first day, we were so frustrated, we just wanted someone from Disney head office to sweep in and sort the place out: refocus and cheer up the staff; improve the food; and add a lick or two of paint to the numerous scrappy and scummy areas that looked like they haven't had a polish since the park opened over twenty years ago.While our LA experience will be held in our minds forever, we feel so let down that our children's first Disney experience was this half hearted reproduction in France.It's a pity   with a bit of energy and focus, this could easily be as magic a kingdom as the American version (I'm Australian, by the way, so I'm not blowing the American trumpet lightly!).","Disneyland_Paris"

First it is smaller and easier to get around. The park can be done in a day, or 2 3 if you are really into the rides. It is easy to get to from public transportation   bus, taxi or MTR. Lines for specific rides or activities can get long. It is best to go during the week, and in the morning when it first opens. They have regular updates to the rides, with the newest one being the addition of Star Wars and the soon to be completed Iron Man ride. I don't love amusement parks (lines, prices, etc), but this was a really easy and fun day for our child. Sometimes sacrifices must be made. :)","Disneyland_HongKong"

Later its better to punch fast passes and time yourself accordingly. The laser show at 8:30 pm was amazing. Make sure you fins a nice place at the round park just before the main castle timely! Imp tip: DO NOT waste time shopping before 6 pm. We realized this later. Since the park closes at 6 pm and the shops are open till the fireworks and laser show starts. Make sure you take the return ticket before travel to save time while returning back to Paris city.","Disneyland_Paris"

We now also stay off site as its cheaper, but if its your first only visit a on site hotel is fabulous.,I always feel excited as I enter the park and look down main street towards the castle. Our families must do rides are: Buzz Lightyears Laser Blast (great for all ages), Star Tours, Pirates of the Caribbean, Peter Pans Flight and Big Thunder Mountain, to name but a few.Food and drinks can be expensive, so its a good idea to take some things in with you. Get there early to beat the queues and use fastpasses. While you are waiting for your fastpass time you can ride another ride and then ride with little wait using your fastpass. You can also get another fastpass as soon as the time begins on the one you already hold. So you can be in your new fastpass waiting time while riding the ride you already had one for (hope this makes sense!) All helps cut wait times down. The parades are always very good and shouldnt be missed by first tiimers. They always bring a tear to my eye. Scheduled character meet and greets are always worth the wait, you get more time for photos and no others kids in your photos. There is a Princess Pavillion and one for Mickey. These are great, you can get professional pictures or take your own and get some time on your own with the characters. The impromptu character times in the parks get very manic and everyone crowds around. Its hard to get photos and people push in. There are soooo many souvenirs available to buy. I dont think they are more expensive than the Disney store at home. Its always great to take something back with you, so in my opinion well worth it. Overall, a great day out. Highly recommended.","Disneyland_Paris"

If you gear up for a  Disney Death March  it is quite likely you will have exactly that time. Planning and understanding the fastpass system will go a long way to freeing you from a day of standing in line. Wear a very small backpack and take some waters for the kids to reduce extraneous costs. Throw in a couple of granola bars, its OK. Get out of bed early and be there for rope drop, you can get more done in a couple of hours than the 11AM crowd will in eight. Most of all slow down, look at how much work went into this masterpiece. Look around for a piece of garbage, you rarely ever find one. Most of all learn the rules to the fastpasses, lines can be upwards of 90 minutes in heavy seasons.

The Matterhorn was still being repaired since January. We complained about our Indiana Jones experience specifically as we knew it would be closed for repairs starting on Monday (we went on the Friday before). The cast member said she can give us a fast pass for indiana jones for the next time we come to the park as compensation. I thought this was a joke and we were on Americas Funniest Home Videos. I told her it could be 10 years if ever we return to Disneyland as we frequent Disney World. Her answer to that was no problem, it will still be valid 10 years later. She had absolutely no customer service skills or a functioning brain. Skip this park and go to Universal Studios when in California.

Of course the latest is iron man which is really awesome (has a  free  tour around HK) plus exhibition of good to be true technologies, which kids and teens will love. Expect long queues as usual so plan ahead. If you want to ride as many attractions as possible, be at the site before opening as large crowd usually comes around noon. Suggest to take iron man, hyperspace mountain, lion king, rc racer and runaway mine cars as these where usually the long lines are. Watching parades is a must so suggest to be at the main street prolly 30 mins before the parade starts coz they attract crowd. The ending (fireworks display) is really a must see. This is where you will feel that you are a disney kid. Food: there's limited variety of food and they are really pricey (everything in disney is pricey). Try korean squid .

Everytime I go it's amazing and I make magical memories.The staff (or cast members) are usually fantastic. Any issues can be taken to a guest relations booth and is handled immediately. Sure occasionally rides go down but with that high level technology or for the rides that have been around since opening day that's expected. They're really good about getting them back up as quickly as possible. It's all about making sure they're safe and giving the guest the best experience possible.Splash Mountain is almost always walk on at night, that's my biggest tip about the park. And make use of Fastpass and you'll have a much better day since you'll get a few short lines throughout the day by using those. I recommend at least 3 days in the park, and the park hopper multi day passes are a much better value than a one day ticket.If you're military they have an amazing discount, check with your rec office on base.","Disneyland_California"

This obviously has a huge impact on the Queuing times of the remaining rides, and given that this park does not operate the US online fast pass system it means you will be very stretched to complete the remainder of the rides. Obviously very expensive for us Brits since the brexit exchange rate turmoil but that   s our problem but....entry pricing should reflect the availability of the rides !

I had visited previously about a year and a half before. I have to be honest, nothing had changed in a year and a half and nearly all rides looked old and tacky. We all came to an opinion that Disneyland isn't worth taking kids under the age of around 8 years old too. The rides are very old and tacky. Im not sure when it was built but the idea of the aerosmith coaster seems outdated. The Monsters inc door and mike models for posing for photos were missing handles and were grubby and scratched. Armageddon was a movie that was released over a decade ago. Please get with the times. The stunt show has been going on for years now. I think it needs updating. The smaller children's rides are getting old too. We went on them as our friends 3 year old was under a meter or so high so couldn't ride on many of the rides. The anamatronics are outdated and some of them don't work anymore. The park doesn't feel magical. More of a mission. Queuing is a big problem. You queue for everything. Food, toilet, searches, entrance, exit. We also noticed some of the characters costumes looked like knock offs. (Tigger and Piglets fluorescent fur). Food prices are EXTORSIONATE! And for what you get and the lack of service. Ripped off. That's how I felt. Don't be fooled by the swanky adverts. Come on Disney its supposed to be magical.","Disneyland_Paris"

The last time I went to Eurodisney was in 1997 and after all the years, it's practically the same! The rides haven't been 'modernized' and although it is much bigger, I think HK Disney is better in terms of 'freshness'. It is decades newer than the other disneyland, and it shows. The attractions, shops, to street lamps are 'cleaner', and I have to say much more looked after. I was shocked to see the haunted mansion in Paris, exactly the same as in 1997, in other words it is 13 years outdated! Now the haunted hotel in HK Disney, ah... you have to try for yourselves.Yes HK Disney is small, yes the shows are in Chinese, yes it might be the hottest disneyland in the world but believe me, it still has the right and the credibility to be rightfully called a Disneyland.","Disneyland_HongKong"

( I had been to Disneyworld in Florida and in three full consecutive days I had not been able to see all of it. ) We were awestruck by the beauty, the colourful displays and the cleanliness when we entered the Magical Fantasy Land ! We tried to work out a schedule according to the times and places where shows would be held, as detailed in the free brochure, but soon had to give it up since running from one location to another to keep up with the timings in the vast place was well nigh impossible. Trying another more practical approach, we started exploring with the help of a guide map also provided free. Still, in each attraction we could see only one or two parts before moving on, lest we miss out on many more.Being Sunday, there was a special parade from 3 to 4 and again from 7 to 8 p.m. We could enjoy a boat ride through a  jungle  with mechanised, very realistic animals, had lunch at The Explorer's Club ( there were country   region wise food areas,which sold mostly fast food and also some ethnic dishes ), saw many fairy characters and read a few pages of stories from books displayed on pedestals. We could visit or see stalls of Spider Man, Iron Man and Merman, had a tram ride and also saw The Toy Story. In the evening we enjoyed a song and dance programme in the auditorium before returning to Main Street to watch the display of fireworks at the end of the day. The entrance ticket included all rides and attractions and we did not have to pay anything more except for food and drink and souvenirs of which there was a plethora to choose from at various sales points. Some staff members gave away stickers with pictures of characters and attractions..We boarded our coach to return to the hotel, thrilled, tired, but yearning for more. SPECIAL MENTION : It had become very hot during the day. One of our group members was on a wheel chair and one of the rubber tyres became loose due to the heat. We tried to fix it back, but in vain. We were so grateful to a strong well built Philipino gentleman who helped us get back on track.At the auditorium, the differently abled person was given priority and accommodated in a vantage position along with her escort.RECOMMENDATIONS : 1. Plan for at least two full days to spend at Disneyland to be able to enjoy yourselves at leisure   more if you have young children, who would enjoy rides of which there are many. You have to queue up in many places for which some time should be allowed.2. Carry your own drinking water   it is exorbitantly priced inside !","Disneyland_HongKong"

It was to be a good experience, but the in flux of mainland Chinese tourists during the Chinese New Year break totally ruined the visit. This specific category of tourists do not yet grasp proper manners, and in pursuit of maximizing their return on investment, they would keep pushing their way and cutting queue at every possibility. Common excuses are some family member at the front of the queue when everyone else are toeing the line. And when you dare to even confront them for cutting queues, they cause a major commotion, and challenge you to a fight. Shame on these Mainland Chinese tourists. As an oversea Chinese myself, I could easily observe these Mainland Chinese tourists are despised at for their aggressive behaviors, and the rest of the Chinese folks (Hong Kong, Taiwan, South East Asia, overseas) generally have way better manners. Disneyland HK really needs to implement stricter rules and penalty to these queue jumpers. They are a total nuisance to everyone else.Food by the way is exorbitant as the park totally monopolized the eateries and have little regards for taste. They would first scan your bags for food before entry and force you to dump any, and once you are in there, the food is 3x more expensive than normal Hong Kong caf  , and taste extremely bad. They have the worst food at the whole of Hong Kong! Total rip off from the park.If there's a choice of zero star, I would have given it just that.","Disneyland_HongKong"

The rides are fun, the shows are great, the characters mascots are lovely, the staff are friendly, the amenities are very good, the parades and fireworks display are mesmerizing, etc. Two or three things, however, are quite disappointing in this place: first, the unbearably long queues to the rides and shows; second, the lack of discipline of the local visitors concerning hygiene and trash disposal: and, third, the humidity. Having a fast track ticket doesn't really help that much. You'll have to get a schedule just the same. As to the humidity, perhaps they should put on more mist sprays and have more covered attractions. As to the crowd, perhaps they should limit the number of visitors per day to avoid overcrowding, and also have more personnel assigned to cleaning the premises.","Disneyland_HongKong"

If you stay in the Disney hotels you get the additional benefit of early opening 8 10am.

It makes for an early start but we tend to make the effort, stay in the park for lunch and then (if open) we go back and use the hotel pool in the afternoon. Highly recommend the lunch with the princesses. I believe that Cinderella is always there but the other two princesses change   my girls met sleeping beauty twice and Ariel and Snow White once. If you order the birthday cake then the princesses (and Prince Charming) will sing happy birthday, my girls were thrilled!!! Also, another VERY helpful tip   if your children are dressed up as a character which also represents a ride then you can go to the exit and go to the front of the queue. This was great in high season when the park was very busy. My youngest was dressed up as Snow White do we went round and round on the Snow White and seven dwarfs ride.

There will still be people trying to push in to the front about 5 minutes before it starts!The Disney Dreams show is worth a watch but it is too late for the little ones (starting at 11pm).","Disneyland_Paris"

Disneyland Park and Disney Studios Park on the other hand were terrible. Both where visibly overcrowded and most rides had a waiting time shown of 50 to 70 minutes. I wonder how it must be during peak season. This was supposedly off peak and the chaos was the same each of the 5 days we stayed there. Buying a  FASTPASS  didnt help much as it is not valid between 1 and 4 pm and making a booking gave you a time of 5.30pm or later. Haunted Mansion was closed for refurbishment, Space Mountain was closed due maintenance. The waiting time also was ridiculously long at the fastfood outlets and those few restaurants offering sit down table service you couldnt get a table unless you booked the previous day. All in all a waste of our time and money. We paid for the Disneylandhotel (5 nights at halfboard) with park passes included for 3 of us the stupid price of 4300euro. On a positive note, since we were firced to skip several breakfasts, lunches and dinners, voicing my frustration upon check out, the reception at the hotel offered us a partial refund in exchange for the meal vouchers we were not able to use due overcrowding in the available Disney restaurants. We visited Disney in other countries in previous years and this is about the worse experience we had ever. A very disppointed family who is not ready to repeat this disaster anytime soon. Next time we will choose smaller less crowded attraction parks and say away from this ill organized large production line factory.","Disneyland_Paris"

But for some reason I didn't see that much happiness and exitement around at it was last time (May be it's the economy). The park was very crowded for a weekday. All the major rides had more than an hour waiting. The fast passes ran out. Tired of waiting in lines in the excruciating summer heat we only took the non popular rides like the innovations and Buzz Lightyear. The lazer show at night was awesome as always. But, one thing we liked this time was the downtown. You can take the monorail at the end of the day and get down at the downtown. It's a nice walk to the main gate.","Disneyland_California"

Just unbelievable! As I had been pre warned, I did take (as did my family inc 3 children) all my own food including a lightweight fridge (only weighed 2.5kilos & left it plugged in at the hotel!). We sneaked our picnic lunch in (as bags are searched at the entrance!) in the base of my Granddaughters pushchair!) I brought wine at the airport, as I wasn   t prepared to pay over   7.50 for a small glass! I wish to make it clear we are not a    tight    family but we weren   t prepared to be ripped of wasting money on overpriced and dreadful quality (value range burgers) food! As for Disneyland, it was brilliant! Yes O.K they are doing a few bits of refurbishment on a few areas and it was a bit disappointing to find, after another long walk (!) that some rides were closed. Why they can   t tell you this in their information, is a mystery! But then there is no information on the rides or there suitability to age. Yes they have a height restriction but when you consider my 4yr old grandson, was able to ride    The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and    Crush's Coaster   , for which my daughter and I had no idea that these rides were totally unsuitable for US let alone a small child, who was left tottally traumatised by both rides. It took us a long time to persuade him to return to his favourites    The tea Cups    &    It   s a small world, which was voted our no1 favourite. We stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne, which was peaceful, clean and more than adequate. FINAL TIP  DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU GO! AS ONCE YOUR THERE IT   S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT EVEN BASIC STUFF. ALSO DON   T TELL YOUR KIDS ABOUT THE GETTING AUTOGRAPHS BECAUSE YOU   LL BE LUCKY TO SPOT MICKEY OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOT AND IF YOU DO HE   LL BE SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WANTING THEIR PHOTO TAKEN AND THE CHILDREN DON   T STAND A CHANCE....YOU   VE BEEN WARNED!! ........ENJOY!","Disneyland_Paris"

Living in the UK it's not very often you get to trip over to the west coast park due to distance and cost. I felt it was more for the locals than the tourists, don't get me wrong I enjoyed it a lot but felt a little out of our depths. The rides are fantastic and we managed to meet characters we haven't seen before. For all Disney fans this is a must to visit.At the end of the evening they cancelled the 60th celebration fireworks, this was one of the main excitements of going and the reason we left Disney until the last night of our honeymoon, thought we'd go home on a 'BANG'. This was very gutting and not very well organised. It wasn't until the show was about to begin we knew it was being cancelled due to the weather (slight wind and very very light rain). As a seasoned traveller to Disneyland Paris, where it is usually raining and freezing, I am yet to see them cancel a show.My advice to everyone is check the weather report and adapt your plans so you don't end up disappointed like we did.

It   s the way to go and you can maximize your fast pass experience. Get a fast pass from one park, walk over to the other and get another one there and never really have to wait in line. It was perfect. My advice is to go to Disneyland and get a Fantasmic show first thing in the morning and then hit Space Mountain while the park isn   t crowded yet. Then you can do your fast passes and you   ll enjoy life. Disneyland is such a magical place and I   ll never get tired of it.

Despite most people recommending one day at this park due to it's size we chose two because , when we visited Disney in LA in 07 we spent 10 days and weren't tired of it at all. We also thought it would be fun to take our kids to the Halloween celebrations at the park, which were only thurs sun. The park looked just like it's LA counterpart, and almost felt the same. It kind of lacked something though. Rides are really aimed at younger children as the only big ride is space mountain ( and it had the shortest lines! Go figure). Immaculately clean, but there just wasn't that wow factor I expected. The extra Halloween attractions were not at all what we expected. The haunted hotel, which we thought would be along the lines of a more temporary version of the haunted mansion in LA terrified our kids, aged 9 and 10. There were people dressed as zombies etc jumping out and screaming in the kids faces, along with a blood stained lady who ran at the kids with a man being hung (twitching on the rope!) behind her. Kids cried all the way through it and one had nightmares. That to me wasn't the spirit of Disney at all and I was very disappointed.

Expect busy, expect queuing and you will be fine. We hired a buggy for our (just) 4 year old which was    15 per day but worth it. We tried to queue for rapunzel twice but gave up, the first time after 45 minutes realized the queue was barely moving so the second time we arrived early and the queue was still huge so the children decide they would rather go in rides instead. We went in August which is probably one of their busiest times but every ride had really big queues, there are a few with fast pass systems and I wish I had read a bit about it all before as it took us a while to work it out. You basically use your tickets to get a fast pass and it tells you what time to come back   could be 3 hours in our case but better than the 90 minute queue.We booked a lunch at Auberge De Cendrillon which was costly but absolutely worth it if your children like princesses, there were 3 (plus Prince Charming and a couple of mice from Cinderella   life size not little ones) talking to every table and having picture taken, it really was magical and the food was enjoyable too. You felt like you were away from the madness for a couple of hours. The parade was magical but again expect a but of pushing and shoving   even from adults.

So we had to wait for a VERY long time for anything  including a table for lunch ( you can try back in 2 hours ), and absolute minimum 50 minute waits for rides. We waited 70 minutes in line to go on Space Mountain and were right at the front of the queue only to be told that the ride had broken down and would not be re opening. 70 minutes of our lives we will never get back. However, a useful tip is to make best use of fast passes for rides. But then again, it was Disneyland and you still 'feel the magic'.

I never waited for more than a few minutes and usually ended up with a little kid or a mom whose husband had the kid in their car, or with some other third wheel from the standby lines. I also seen some people  pretending  to be single riders (they were holding hands until the employees running the ride were around, then played it  cool ) so I think you could beat the system that way if you want. I also seen a parade and all the Disney characters...and I think that Disney does a pretty good job with their princess selection...man, they all looked just like the ones in LA! I think they all could do a good job of making my dreams come true someday! haha!And since I was just at Disneyland Anaheim this year too, I can say that HK doesn't match up, but it was a fun way to spend most of my day rather than wander around and see the same old crap in Kowloon the day before I head into China... I took the train from Tsim Sha Tsui (red line) to Lai King and xferred to the orange line to Sunny Bay, then to the Disney line, and it was a pretty easy trip, maybe 40 minutes...I had a good time, probably won't go back, but I can cross it off the list.

So on our way to a French holiday with relatives, we booked 2 nights (at the Vienna Magic Circus which was fab but different review) and a 1 day 2 park pass. Our boys (6 and 4) first visit we were so excited and we had a loose plan of what we wanted to do especially with height restrictions. Few days before noticed a lot was closed like Peter Pan and Space Mountain, disappointed but already booked so not much we could do and we had never been before so didn't realise how bad this would be until there. We hit the Studio park first and the rides that were open like Ratatouille waited 55mins with a 4yr old already doing so well but hadn't even got on and were evacuated off as it had broken down. Went straight to Crush Coaster and after 20mins same thing happened it broken down. We headed to Toy Story Parachute and Hollywood Tower but there were over 90mins waits because there was nothing else running so everyone was hitting them. Advertised as a midi day (a May Friday not in school hols) but couldn't see how they could have got ANY more people in the parks and it was 25C so even getting a bottle of water was a mission and more queing. We went over to the Disney park hoping to at least see some characters but unlike my friend said a few months ago they are not walking about anymore it's a ... You guessed it, Que system at least 55mins alll day to see Mickey. So by now it's 1pm and the boys have done NOTHING, except que but been on no rides or seen any characters! My 6yr old just broke down I actually have a video of him saying  Disneyland isn't as fun as I thought  it was heartbreaking. We ended up going on 3 small rides like Small world and the Tea cups (can pay   1.50 at our local fun fayre to do) and watched the parade but all we did the whole day was que in boiling sun and ply the kids out of guilt with ice creams, treats and hot dogs (4 plain hot dogs, 2 bottles of water and a Coke 41E and a 30mins wait!!) more money in Disney's pocket though as you're trapped... very clever. We were told it was open until 10pm so after the parade Bee lined for the studio again to try Ratatouille but that park closes at 6pm!! No one mentioned this. I had tried to get fast passes but all gone and we spoke to a few who had got them for Ratatouille but they couldn't use them as it was broken down anyway, I did complain as we left but they didn't want to know. We gave up then, boys could barley speak from exhaustion and they had spied Planet Hollywood in the village which we then bigged up as  Pizza planet  from Toy story as they didn't get to see Buzz and Woody as hoped. Again 35min wait for a table then over an hour for our food, even the waiter was apologising. 100E for greasy pizza and a few drinks. Totally devastated for my boys feel I totally let them down by building up so much doing big reveal bags with outfits etc WOULD NOT return, total rip off.","Disneyland_Paris"

As this is not a bragging forum suffice to say what work had done was excellent.Disney itself was just like the one in California; getting a bit tired around the edges and in need of some updating.A word of warning to visitors though you CANNOT anywhere in the park get an alcoholic drink and there are 2 (yes only 2) locations where you can feed your nicotine habit and it goes without saying they are a bit on the busy side.Long long long queues for anything and at the weekends its totally FULL of visitors who in December were stripping the shelves of everything and anything so if you want to buy a specific item buy it as you go in as the chances are if you look at the end of your day there will be little or nothing left in the stores.Announcements for non Chinese visitors are in  chinglish  and difficult to understand","Disneyland_HongKong"

And also made the trips to the attractions that less tiring.From the airport, we took a taxi to the hotel and was greeted well by the reception. It wasn't long before we were in the hotel itself and enjoying the comfy beds...Hey, but we're here to enjoy the attractions right? So, in no time at all, we all went around looking for the attractions. The hotel provided free coach services to the Disneyland itself, and am very glad that they catered for families with small ones using strollers etc. The kids were really excited the first evening we went out   and that excitement never really abated the 3 nights and four days we were there. All the rides and atttractions are as what you would expect, and never having the chance to see the original Disneyland, I guessed it was a lot smaller here in Hong Kong. Probably the only downside was how expensive meals were here. The prices are really high   but I guess that's how the make money. Still, it was quite a good thing for them to have halal food outlets here   with the number of visitors from the Middle East and Malaysia Indonesia   they would have lost a good proportion of possible income otherwise. Won't go in lengths about the attraction this time, just suffice to say they are there and made the kids really happy! The nightly fireworks show were also a nice way to say goodbye.","Disneyland_HongKong"

We knew from other reports the park is smaller. That part wasn   t the disappointment of the visit. We were here the last week in December and it was cold (32 degree F, 0 C). As all Disney parks, it was crowded. Lines were at least an hour minimum and the cold made it unbearable to wait. We didn   t purchase the fast pass tickets (will triple the cost). If we really wanted to do the rides , we should have gotten them. The worst part were the lines for food. Seems all the food venues were packed. It took over 70 minutes to get hot dogs at Casey   s. Their system is highly inefficient. Seems they have not deployed the preorder system they have in the US parks. The Walt Disney studio park seemed better equipped (shorter lines for food).

That means you don't have to wait in the long line and have one hour from the time on your ticket to show up. What a blast it was, riding at night and seeing all of the Christmas lights! Riding the teacups was also a hit as was seeing families and kids enjoying themselves.

Make sure you line up for a fastpass for the Cars Racing Ride first up as this ride is the busiest and fast passes will sell out by early afternoon. We found the food at the park reasonably priced and bought lunch or dinner there, rather than wasing time to leave and come back. Make sure you see all of the night shows   Fireworks, World of Color and Mickey Mouse vs The Evil Queen. They are spectacular and I think the best attractions at both the parks. You can get a fastpass for the World of Color which will ensure you get a good viewing spot. Otherwise people start waiting in good viewing spots a 2 hrs prior. ","Disneyland_California"

350442413,5,"2016-2","United States","We visited with a 3 year old and one year old, both of whom loved it. Whilst there's not loads for the one year old they can go on some rides and there's lots going on around them which ours loved just watching. For the three year old there's plenty, and as much of it is aimed at smaller kids it doesn't have the huge queues of the bigger roller coasters. Highlights were the character meetings (all long queues though), it's a small world and ofcourse the parade. Thoughts on the rides we did are below:BUZZ LIGHTYEARThe only one we could do that has fastpass and I'd say one of the least memorable. I (dad) probably had the most fun whereas our daughter (3) mostly enjoyed spinning our cart and less the rest. A bit over stimulating for our son (1).NAUTILUSPretty poor. We had no queue. I'd have been annoyed if we'd waited. It's just a walkthrough with limited displays.AUTOPIALittle ones (over 84cm) can drive and our daughter absolutely loved it. You go around a guided track, and for older kids I expect it would be dull, but for a 3 year old it's amazing!CASEYOk. It's a pretty average mini rollercoaster. IT'S A SMALL WORLDThe surprise of the trip for us, in that we'd not anticipated it. It's basically a boat ride through lots of animated models dressed up as being from around the world, singing and dancing. It really is perfect for little ones. Loads to see and it takes a little while so you can settle in and watch them enjoy it and clap along.MEET THE PRINCESSESA lovely experience for our 3 year old daughter, although a very long and boring queue to get there (one hour). We took advantage of the one year old's nap time, otherwise it might have been a challenge.MEET MICKEYAnother long queue but mostly infront of a big screen showing Mickey cartoons, so quite manageable. Well set up and obviously meeting Mickey is a big draw for the overall park so great for that.DUMBOKids loved this   they can control the height of the car, which was perfect. And quite a small queue (relatively!).CAROUSELPretty standard if you've done these before, but nicely set up.ENCHANTED FORESTA fun 20mins with jungle book characters signing along, and tarzan apparently (I didn't go, but my wife was quite pleased with this bit!).MEET MINIThere are lots of character meetings in the park. Only the princesses and mickey are in buildings, and we only went to mini apart from that. Daughter loved it, although a long queue (45mins) for a 2 min hello.ALICE'S LABYRINTHGood fun for all. Bigger kids and teens tear through it, so you need to keep an eye out, but that asides both our little ones loved exploring it.MAD HATTERS TEA CUPSGreat for the kids. They loved spinning the cart around.DISNEY ON PARADEThis is a huge highlight and well worth doing. You need to go to the route early and get a spot, or be prepared to be a few rows back. We went 30mins early each day and got to the front which meant the kids could see well and got the occasional high 5 from the cast, which they loved.FOODA quick note on this. As well written elsewhere there's a lot of fast food in the park. It's ok, pretty standard, pricey but not crazy expensive. The restaurants outside are better (in the village, so through security but before you need a ticket to get into the parks themselves). At a couple of them the characters come to your table. They're great for that, but you pay for it in the food price. Overall, you've not come to Disney for the food, and probably just as well!","Disneyland_Paris"

Our first couple of days were during the extreme heat wave so the characters were not out walking around as well the monorail was closed due to lack of air conditioning. Once the temperatures dropped however things were back to normal.Disneyland is an amazing place and tomorrowland is still my favorite land in the park. They did change space mountain to hyperspace mountain for Star Wars which was cool although it is debatable if it was better before the change. Speaking of Star Wars, your young kids can sign up to battle Darth Vader or The Seventh Sister on stage, or meet Chewy or Kylo Ren. They are building a new Star Wars land which I believe is supposed to open in 2 years. Because of the construction of Star Wars land the railroad ride is closed which was disappointing because it used to be a good way to get around to the different lands within the park.I would love to go here more often, unfortunately the cheapest part of this trip is the flight from Canada, the prices for everything at Disneyland are just so expensive it is almost criminal. Even the cheapest Mickey Mouse Ears hats that you can get your name embroidered on the back is a money trap when they give you the option of the simple thin writing for $3 or the nicer thicker embroidered name for $7 on top of the price of the hat. Eating in the park will drain your wallet faster than you can imagine so we took advantage of the close proximity of the restaurants located just outside of the parks to save a little.Meeting the characters usually involve long lines, however some characters you can meet multiple character in 1 line such as Winnie the Poo, Tigger and Eyore which helps with the kids. The ride lines can also be long sometimes so remember to take advantage of the fast pass option. Hit the busy rides early in the morning before the park fills up or late in the evening after younger kids leave and then visit the shops mid day when it is hottest and busiest.Overall this is still the place to go with your kids for a very memorable magical vacation, it is expensive but if you know this in advance and plan and save for it then you will be able to enjoy all that the park has to offer without the stress of worrying so much about the money.I will visit again in the future even after my kids are grown!","Disneyland_California"

266514563,5,"2015-3","Japan","My husband and I took our daughter to HKDL for her 25th birthday. We live in Japan, and have been to Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Sea (collectively known as Tokyo Disney Resort, TDR) numerous times. I grew up 20 minutes from California Disneyland, so I went there many times also, and I've been to California Adventure several times. We have become so used to the average 2 hour lines at TDR that we were really overwhelmed by the lack of people at HKDL. It was amazing. Maybe it was the time we went, after the Chinese New Year holidays...One thing that made us laugh out loud was while we were standing in line waiting to get in (the Park opens at 10 a.m., quite late), and we heard a male voice lament in English,  Everyone is here!!!  He's never been to Tokyo, where the line on opening day for Toy Story Mania was 8 hours long! I almost told him to go there. There were perhaps 150 people waiting around, while in any one line of 20 or more at TDR there are 150 people. There were no lines at any attraction, except for the Golden Mickeys, and then we only had to wait for the previous show to end and we went right in. When lines at TDR can reach up to 6 hours or more on weekends and holidays, it was so fun to just walk right in and get on the attractions. All our friends who love Disneyland anywhere were quite stunned.The Park was extremely clean, including the restrooms, as is expected of a Disneyland. The details were spot on, too. Toy Story Land was very small, but awesome! Everyone spoke English, which was great for me. The only hitch to that was the Jungle River Cruise attraction, where you choose English, Mandarin, or Cantonese lines before you board the boat. Our English speaking guide surely was speaking English, but none that I had ever heard of. Everyone in the boat was looking at each other and shrugging. It was quite disappointing, as I'd read this was a fun experience.We had plenty of opportunity to meet lots of characters. The wait was just a few minutes. We got a Fast Pass to see Anna and Elsa of Frozen first thing in the morning, and the return time was around 11:15, but otherwise we just strolled up and waited our turn for Duffy and ShellieMay, Buzz Lightyear, Cinderella, Mickey, Minnie, and Goofy, and we saw several others but we already had their autographs.Tomorrowland was empty. We could ride Space Mountain twice and have our pick of seats. The Buzz Lightyear attraction was also empty. Instead of shooting at things as you usually do on the attraction, I just sat back and enjoyed the ride, knowing we'd go on it again. We missed the Stitch Encounter English show as the timing wasn't right. You have to go to the attraction to find out when the times are for the various languages. This show is similar to Turtle Talk at other Disney Parks, I think.Fantasyland had the most attractions of any Land, with Dumbo being the most popular. We went on the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. It's similar but slightly different than in other Parks. The Golden Mickeys show was fun. It was done in Cantonese, with simplified Chinese and English subtitles on screens to the left and right of the stage. The show was similar to the Oscars or Emmys, with various (Disney) movies and characters being nominated, but no one is actually named a winner, which was a little disappointing. Of course, ALL the characters and movies presented were winners! Sleeping Beauty's Castle was really small! You could walk through it in less time than it takes to greet someone. And the top half was covered with wooden boards, and that half of the castle was painted on the boards! I hope that this was to cover repairs being done. it's a small world was as enjoyable as ever, and we even got our own private boat!Adventureland had only the Jungle River Cruise and Tarzan's Treehouse, which is on a little island reached by raft, a la Tom Sawyer's Island, though once you got there, there was only the Treehouse, and nowhere else to go. The rest of the island is off limits. When we were there, scaffolding covered the whole Treehouse. The whole area of Adventureland had plenty of wooden carvings, and a place to rest with various drum type instruments you can play with. The Festival of the Lion King show was also closed, another great disappointment. Grizzly Gulch was nearly all closed. The Runaway Mine Car attraction, perhaps the most exciting, was closed for maintenance. My daughter and I were really looking forward to the fish and chips sold at the Silver Nugget Saloon, but that place, too, was closed. It really was like a ghost town!Mystic Point was fun and interesting, with the Mystic Garden trick art a high point. Mystic Manor itself has some very interesting displays along the way toward where you board your vehicle, but as there were no people in line in front of us, we just zipped along. This attraction is really interesting, and unlike the Haunted Mansion it replaces. The outside looks nothing like the Haunted Mansion, though the sign on the gatepost looks similar in font and plaque styles, but inside there are several rooms that are similar, with different decorations, of course. Look for those!Toy Story Land was compact, but really colorful and fun. As someone who grew up with nearly all the toys there, it was nostalgic. We went on the Slinky Dog Spin, and it wasn't as fast or stomach churning as we had thought it would be. The same goes for the Green Army Men Parachute Drop. Watching it beforehand, it reminded me of the Tower of Terror's many ups and downs, but it didn't feel the same. Not as stomach lifting. We skipped RC Racer, though it was fun to watch.Main Street was very compact, filled with nice shops. Even at the close of the Park, there were few people in the shops, so we could shop without being bumped. There were some items sold at great discounts, so this was a pleasant surprise. We went for one whole day, plus a a few hours the next day before our flight back home. The whole experience just made us want to stay longer, or at least go back again. We are already planning that for next year around the same time! Before you go, make sure you check the Chinese holiday calendar  and avoid any holidays! Go during the week, not on the weekends.","Disneyland_HongKong"

I have been to Disneyland in Florida many times especially during Christmas and unfortunately there are a few things that let it down. Disneyland Paris being one of the smallest parks, it's fair to say I was expecting pretty little. To my surprise I had a better time than I have in Orlando! Although there is definitely not as much to see and ride: there is no way near the mass amount of people. We were fortunate enough to have booked to go in on a 'blackout day' where the park is only open to hotel guests and annual members. Due to this we were able to ride as many rides as possible with only a couple of minutes wait...although meet & greets still took up to 30 mins. At the Disney park they have the best rides from the parks in my opinion such as Rock and roller coaster, crush's coaster and my all time favourite it's a small world. The food and restaurants in Disneyland Paris is what made the park stand out so much for me as it is miles ahead of both Florida and California. We ate at The steakhouse, cafe Mickey and Auberge de cindrillon. Although without the meal vouchers they would be quite expensive  it is by far the easiest & quickest way to meet the characters. The food in all these places was incredible!","Disneyland_Paris"

My little girl met all the characters and had photos taken and my 10 year old enjoyed the rides and the experience, everything is relatively expensive so it will be probably only be a once in a lifetime adventure but I'm mighty glad we did and don't regret a minute.","Disneyland_Paris"

171030455,4,"2013-8","United States","For the first time in probably a decade I went to the Disneyland resort in Anaheim, CA. Although I live within 10 miles of the place I had stayed away due the extreme costs involved even when taking in account the Southern California resident discounts that are offered. But we now have a young grandson living with us so we have bit the bullet and purchased annual passes. Without a doubt the best way to enjoy the park is through the eyes of a child.Some things to note; if you're coming during the summer be aware that it is always crowded, but Saturdays and Sundays are extremely crowded. There are long lines for every popular ride. If possible try and visit during the week. Either way take full advantage of the FastPass option for the busiest rides. FastPass allows you to bypass the long lines for a greatly reduced wait time. If you're going to be in the area for only one day you will want to purchase the Park Hopper ticket allowing you to enjoy both Disneyland Park and California Adventure. If you're planning on spending a couple of days at the resort then multiple day tickets are the right choice. Of course if you live in the area then consider the annual passes. They have a number levels with the least expensive having a lot of blackout days. If you get the annual pass include parking on at least on pass (an extra charge except on the premium pass). Currently parking is $16 for autos. If staying for just a couple of hours you can also park at Downtown Disney which is free parking for the first three hours. However, the cost jumps pretty quickly once you   re there beyond the three hours. The one issue I have with the attraction is, as mentioned before, the extreme cost involved. Currently for a one day, one park ticket it's $92 per person. For a one day Park Hopper it's $137. Children 3 9 are a little less ($86 & $131) and children under three are free. But for an out of town family of four you're talking between $356   $536 just to walk in the place. That doesn't include parking, food & drinks, souvenirs, etc. Again that is for just one day. Being this is Southern California there are other attractions in the area, the best alternative being Knott's Berry Farm just a few miles down the freeway. Not as big or famous as Disneyland but still a blast. It is also much less expensive so you may want to consider a day there as well instead of tying up all your days at Disneyland.Overall I highly recommend visiting the Disneyland Resort if you can comfortably afford it. It is a magical trip that can take you away from the troubles of the world, at least for a short time.","Disneyland_California"

148257596,3,"2012-9","Australia","I was expecting an absolute wow factor from Disney. Disney usually pay such attention to detail, that everything is almost perfect; our experience fell far short of wow.In previous years, we have visited the Disney Theme parks in Orlando, and the Paris theme park is no where near on the same scale, or experience in terms of quality.We visited in September 2012 for our son's 2nd birthday, and stayed at the Disneyland Hotel (please see other review for hotel). This review is for the theme park itself.The rides and experiences are ok, but there are a few things you need to consider prior to booking a trip to Paris over the Orlando theme parks.  Smoking is allowed within the park itself, and as someone from the UK where there is usually less smoking, we often found ourselves passing people smoking all around the park, rather than having designated smoking areas. Personally, I have nothing against people who smoke, but, I not agree with smoking around young children; I would have thought Disney would have a no smoking policy, with designated smoking areas, especially as the park is aimed at younger children.  The queuing system is not as efficient as the other parks in Orlando, therefore waiting for rides can take longer than expected. One example was the train which goes around the whole park had been leaving with seats empty. We then waiting a further 15 minutes for the next train; this can be frustrating when you see seats empty, and more of a challenge keeping a 2 year old occupied for 15 minutes in a line waiting. We also often saw other rides leaving with seats empty.  Fast Ticket system   there are only 3 rides in the park for little ones with a fast past ticket system, so get used to waiting in long queues with little ones. Even if using the fast ticket, there is still a long queue. We waited 15 minutes just to get a fast pass ticket from the machine. When we returned to the Buzz Light Year ride, we entered the 'fast pass' queue, and then waited another 30 minutes to get onto the ride.  On the restaurants over this busy weekend, 2 out of the 3 casual dining restaurants had been closed (Buzz LightYear and Aladdin closed), which left one casual dining restaurant opened, which was so busy it meant we lived on 'fast food' most of the weekend. Fast Food is expensive, we paid 3 euros for a bottle of Coke.  The Theme Park map is in English, but there is still some French on the map. We spoke basic French and was ok, but we had been talking to others from the UK who had asked us to translate.Overall, it was a good experience for our small family, but not a 'great' experience you expect from Disney. Especially considering how expensive the experience is.The rides are fun (if they are open), walking around the park is fun, but be expected to queue, book the 'casual dining' restaurants in advance, and understand that smoking in public around children is part of the culture.If I could do this again, having visited both Orlando and Paris Disney parks, I would have preferred to wait until next summer, save up a little more, and go to Orlando from the UK rather than Paris.","Disneyland_Paris"

18817634,5,"missing","United Kingdom","We were slightly dreading taking our 6 and 3 year olds to Disneyland Paris this summer and indeed we even bottled a trip we were planning last Christmas because of the terrible reviews we'd read about the park and the hotels. Well, without wishing to sound smug, I think we've cracked it completely and discovered how to have an amazing time at Disneyland Paris. The snag? It'll cost you, but it's worth every penny.We rented an Empire State suite at the New York hotel, with another family, who had an adjoining room to ours. Our room was perfectly adequate for all of us; my husband and I had a huge kingsize bed and the children shared a perfectly good double sofa bed. We thus had a seating area during the day, whilst the childrens' bed was put away. The bathroom was immaculate and we had a great view. Lovely touches were that the children were given huge Mickey mouse mugs, filled with sweets on the first day, and also beautiful autograph books photo albums with gold pens, as part of our service.Down the hall came our first big win. A small private dining room, which was open all day and evening, where we had breakfast, accompanied only by a few other families who were also staying on our 'exclusive' floor. We had access to free soft drinks, hot drinks, cakes and newspapers throughout the day. Best of all was the breakfast buffet, which was superb. The real icing on the cake however was that we were visited during breakfast, by a host of different characters, including Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, Donald's Uncle and more. It was fabulous and a bit surreal to be joined at our table by Mickey. The children were overwhelmed and were able to spend lots of time with each character and we had ample photo opportunities. A far cry from the large queues we saw down in the lobby for the other guests to briefly meet the characters at set times during the day.As if this wasn't enough, our trump card was getting VIP fast passes included in the package. From 11am we were entitled to go to any ride with a fast pass (which is practically all of them) and to go straight through. We didn't have allocated fast pass times, like regular fast passes, which mean that you would normally queue to get the pass and then would only be able to cash in your pass during an allotted time and would only be allowed to hold one pass at a time. We simply walked straight onto rides whenever we wanted, that often had queues of up to an hour or more. It was absolutely brilliant and meant that not only did the children thoroughly enjoy themselves, but all the adults did too and therefore we got the very best possible holiday out of our four days.Compare this with a recent trip to Legoland I made with the children. Two hours to get there in the car and we made it onto two rides in the entire day, having queued for over 4 hours in total for those two rides. What a disaster!I went expecting all the negative things I'd heard about Disneyland Paris to be true, but I only came away with one complaint, which was the way the Princesses were so hidden away and impossible to meet without forking out an extortionate amount of money for a Princess dinner, or without queueing for over 2 hours. This disappointed my 3 year old girl, but she got over it quickly as she was having such a great time. The park was very clean and tidy, the attention to detail in every inch of the place was incredible (compare with Chessington, which oh so badly needs a facelift!) the staff we met were absolutely lovely and never rude and because we never had to queue, we never experienced the nightmare queue barging we'd heard so much about. We also stayed in a hotel about 2 minutes walk from the village, so never had to contend with shuttle buses either. it was all a hugely pleasant surprise.We bought the unofficial guide to Disneyland Paris from Amazon before we went and it was brilliant. We more than made up for the cost by using the 20% off voucher in the back for Planet Hollywood. We used the authors' advice about where to eat and thus avoided the revolting food and totally rip off prices experienced by so many guests at Disney (stick to Planet Hollywood, McDonalds and Cafe Mickey (book the latter) and you should be pleasantly surprised.) We went off brief for one meal and sorely regretted it...the Rainforest Cafe was a disaster and we ended up with a grovelling manager refunding us half the cost of the meal, it was so revolting late overpriced. The shops were brilliantly well stocked and yes they are expensive in comparison to the Disneystore back in the UK, but the merchandise is on the whole wonderful quality and hugely diverse.So, the crunch is the cost. We went during high season (the school summer holidays) and paid just under   1200 per family of four for 3 nights 4 days. We saved money by travelling from Dover to Calais on the ferry. Having paid not dissimilar prices in the past for Centerparcs, we felt the value for money this offered at Disneyland Paris was absolutely fantastic. Everyone I know who tried to do it on the cheap, including family, who couldn't believe we were going to go after they'd all gone on and on about how dreadful the whole experience can be, had a ghastly time. We had a brilliant time and are thoroughly looking forward to trying Florida in a few years time. It's a no brainer...save up the pennies and only go once instead of multiple times, but do it in style!","Disneyland_Paris"

372993546,3,"2015-6","Italy","The park is beautiful, one has to admit, it is also spotlessly clean but the queues are AWFUL. We visited it in May 2015 for 3 days during the week and I don't know if we came across some school holidays in France but it was fairly busy. We hated the queues: When you are with small kids (or even for us adults), you can't be expected to wait online for (at least) 2 hours for an attraction. It also happened twice that the attraction then shut down all of a sudden because of a technical problem. So then we had to come back the next day. Also the Fast pass doesn't really work. You have to queue for that too and the tickets are only given at certain times of the day, so chances are if you are not quick enough to get the tickets, they will be already finished before you even get to the Fastpass machine.We liked very much the Ratatouille attraction, which is truly great fun, and the stunt show in the Disney Studios. Some other attractions were also nice but everything was tainted by the incredibly long queues. The restaurants are very expensive, you need to reserve the ones with the Disney characters and make sure you respect the time you booked. The quality of the food is not great, so not good value for money. The dinner with the princesses was nice and also the one with Mickey and company but expensive and rushed (at least the one with Mickey). We had booked a package with dinners so I recommend that, if you want to the children to see the characters. There was also a Wild West Show, which was great but had to be payed separately.The park is a great commercial stunt. You can't help buying stuff. We were not lucky with the weather, it was cold and rainy and that's not the best weather condition to visit the park and queue for hours. Of course then you must buy rain coats and all which will impact on your budget. So I recommend you bring rainboots and raincoats if you are planning to visit during a time when it could rain. We stayed at the New York Hotel, that was such a disappointment. The buffet breakfast in the morning is appaling, worse than a fast food and the room are basic and do not look clean. I would certainly not go there again.","Disneyland_Paris"

I can't emphasize enough to spend the few dollars and plan your trip with the software RIDE MAX. Use www.ridemax.com for a few bucks and we went in the middle of summer with a 3 day dual park pass and never waited in line once and saw it all. The trick was to use the software and jump back and forth between parks during your day. The 2 parks fast pass systems are not connected to you can load up on fast passes all morning long and then return all afternoon and evening and never wait in line! TIP   use your fast pass any time later in the day, they never expire and never refuse a fast pass as long is it is for that day and past the first time you can use it. Check out the Disboards for tons of tips and hints. Pack small snacks and water bottles and they never get taken away at check in. Start each day at the magical kingdom. Grab Star Tours and all the big popular ones first and then head over to the opening of Calfiornia adventures park and grab soaring fast pass, then water show passes and then line up for the Toy Story ride first. You will need one deisgnated runner for the group to do all your fast pass pick up but it is all worth it. You will need one person to hold your spot for Fantasmic, Water show and parades too! Bring a blanket to place out for helping hold spot for your family, it works good. Hope you have a more magical experience from these tips.","Disneyland_California"

It's a pity with the numbers of visitors per years, the park can afford to make an effort for its many visitors. Obviously with all these people we have to wait minimum 1 or 2 hours to take a ride... I have already visited alot of theme parks in France or other border countries, like Germany with Europapark, and it was so much better, same size, more amusement rides, and the price is much more justified!!Even if it does not escape the tourists, Disneyland Paris should improve its park or revise its exorbitant prices.","Disneyland_Paris"

During our second visit it snowed, and I don't mean just a small flurry, this was a full on blizzard. It was freezing and I can recommend that anyone travelling during this time invests in snow suits and boots for their little ones. We hired 2 of the strollers and found these to be invaluable as they ploughed through the snow and kept our children out of the freezing snow. They also served as good transport for taking 2 tired children back to the hotel, which was a 15 minute walk away.The food in the park is not fantastic. All McDonald's style at a premium price and we struggled to find something that our children would eat, however there are eateries outside of the park and the convenience store in the train station sells premade sandwiches.You'll be hard pushed not to get carried away with the Disney Magic and I believe that at least one visit for families is a must.","Disneyland_Paris"

It's true what they say you really do forget everything that is going on outside when you are there.Highly recommend visiting with kids or without kids! If you have stayed in a Disney hotel and have access to extra magic hours use them....it is definitely worth getting to the parks for 8 830.The parades and night shows, at both parks, are a must see. Use fast passes where possible. Download the app, as this has parade and show times and ride wait times.Yes...you have to queue for the popular rides and it is over priced but it's Disney, so it is expected! Will definitely visit again...just amazing!!!","Disneyland_Paris"

On Monday the queues for most rides was okay, so didn't bother with fast pass. On the Tuesday it was extremely busy with large queues on most rides, and up to 60 75mins wait on some rides in both parks and the fast track queues where also long. Also long queues to see the characters.The parades in both parks are good and the light show at the end of the evening was amazing. Everything is expensive but I was prepared for that. Its easier to eat tea before the lights show as afterwards its very busy. Its worth buying a guide book to get the best out of Disney (I used the Brits guide).My children loved it at Disney and want to go back.","Disneyland_Paris"
116699312,5,"2011-8","Canada","Can't imagine what one could write that you don't already know about Disneyland, but I'll start with the fact that I am 42, live in the Midwest, but have been to Disneyland on over 30 different occasions, about half of them for 2   4 day stretches. Several years ago (probably more like 10), I was at Disneyland when they closed the gates due to attendance for only the 4th time ever. The park was so crowded you could not enjoy yourself   I think we rode 4 rides that day. Ever since, I have done my best to avoid the crowded times. However, this summer, I wanted to take the kids to Disneyland as a surprise before school started. Due to making plans late, the only time we could go, and stay at the Grand Californian (which I wanted to try), was to arrive on a Saturday and leave on a Monday. My first instinct was  yuck . But I figured with California Adventures, Downtown Disney, and the pools and activities at the hotel, we could keep busy without being worn out all day in the crowds. I had gotten the package with the 4 day park hopper pass. We arrived late Friday afternoon. After checking in, we made it to the park at about 4:30. I thought it was okay   busy of course since it was summer, but not ridiculous. That night, Disneyland got more and more busy, and after the fireworks, people were shoulder to shoulder in Tomorrowland   that was enough for me. The next morning, we got early entrance at 7:00, but waited to go until 7:25 so there were no lines. We were able to due Space Mountain and the new Star Tours twice before 8:00. When the park opened, those lines went from 5 minute waits to 50 minute waits within a half hour. Then we did Buzz Lightyear about 6 or 7 times with no wait. Then we explored some of the other parts of the park. I was pleasantly surprised. We took a break after lunch and returned to the park at 5:00 after swimming. The evening was busier, but not too bad. Saturday, which I had heard you should always try to avoid, was, in reality, pretty good.The next day, Sunday, was noticeably more busy from the start and remained so throughout the day. We left and went to California Adventures before lunch and it was less busy, except for Soarin    over California and the Toy Story ride, each with about a 50 minute wait. California Screaming, the roller coaster, was only 25 minutes. Tower of Terror was maybe 10 minutes tops. Monday was clearly the busiest day of all, leading me to believe that people still try to avoid weekends, and then everyone ends up ready to go Monday morning, and it is madness.In summary, I think there has been so much stigma about weekends that attendance has been affected and the worse day of the week well may be Monday. Summer is nice for the long hours, but a Wednesday in January is still my pick to enjoy this magical place.","Disneyland_California"

You expect to queue for rides but I wasn   t expecting the long queues in the eating places, they even went out onto the street. It   s really really expensive.   3.50 for a small bottle of water or soda,    16 for a burger and chips and the food is also pretty vile. You can   t help but feel ripped off. Rides were great, we loved them, and that   s what we went for. However it   s really annoying when you've queued for over an hour to get right to the front and be told the ride   s broken down. What   s that all about? The rides are constantly being interrupted on and off the whole time. You trek across the park to go on a ride and are told it   s not working. I don   t get why it happens ALL the time. One morning we went from one ride to the next and were told at each one that it was shut. They told us    5 minutes    at Pirates of the Caribbean and were turning others away saying    it   s closed, we don   t know how long   . So.... really overpriced, really long queues for everything, and rides that could very well be    temporarily interrupted    on the day you visit. Oh, and my kids were also shocked to see people puffing away on cigarettes all over the place. The staff are generally complacent about everything though and in this respect it   s also very different from Florida.","Disneyland_Paris"

It could have been a wonderful experience for us to re visit the park again after so many years if not for the incident with a Chinese lady who is around her early 50s. What happened was my children wanted to take the Cinderella Carousel and I was so glad I went with them. My son was trying to climb up onto one of the horses while I was holding my young daughter when this Chinese lady try going up from the other side of the horse (we were there first). Being an adult, her actions were swifter comparing to a child and her feet almost landed on my son's face. I quickly pull my son away and scolded that lady for being so uncivilised and she is old enough to be a grandmother and yet snatching from a young child. She did not say anything and she crossed over to another horse beside ours. She don't dare to look at us throughout the ride as I was staring at her lol...anyway, we enjoyed our visit to the theme park despite that incident. Looking forward to our next visit. ** An advice to visitors with young kids: parents please accompany your child children for all rides because there are just too many uncivilised people around. Safety comes first and you won't know what will happen next. ","Disneyland_HongKong"

I visited with my friends in mid April, strategically avoiding the spring easter holidays as well as going in the middle of the week to avoid weekend crowds and it worked out brilliantly for us. It was still busy, but the majority of queues were 15 20mins (even for the popular rides) with the longest wait being 35mins in the middle of the day. However, because the lines were constantly moving it didn't feel like you were waiting that long, and the rides were worth it! Because of the lack of queues, we only used fast pass once and occassionally we split up to availl of single rider queues which were usually only 5 mins wait and so got through alot quicker. Some rides we even went through twice, so we definitely got good value for our money.Some rides were understandably closed for renovation, but there was still so much to see and to do. We got the 2 day 2 park tickets and felt that allowed to fully see both parks and to avail of all the shows parades the parks put on. As I said before, this is not the first time I have been to disney, so I loved all the new changes throughout the park and the new touches added to the rides. It keeps the experience fresh and exciting for reoccuring visitors. I also noticed the increasing awareness and accessibility for wheelchair users and those with other disabilities throughout the park, which I must admit (and I'm sorry if I'm wrong) I did not notice when I was last there 10 years ago and I think that it is brilliant!I was expecting shops and food to be expensive because...you know...Disney, but it honestly actually wasn't as bad as I had built it up to be in my head!

Older kids would be worth it, but paying $93 for a 3 year old is bit ridiculous. My major complaint: We intentionally went on a day that would hopefully be less busy. (Although it was PLENTY busy.) We paid full price for us and our toddler (only a $7 discount   really??). Anyway, my point is we paid full price for a shorter day. (Closed at 8). And at 5 pm we went to a restaurant back in critter country that I had scoped out ahead of time for our gluten free needs. They were closed!!! They closed other places early too.

We also found it to be too full for the size of the 2 parks they have. they seem to pack it out to its absoulute maximum although we have visited florida in summer holidays too and found that to also be too much, que times are silly and we did notice that in france when they say 25 mins for que time they mostly get itwrong as we found it to be more like 40 mins. we also found rides broke down a lot! we were on rocking roller coaster, it broke down. as did buzz ride and crushes coaster and maybe it was just bad luck but ive been florida a few times and never experienced a ride breaking down! . without being too personal id like to mention that We found many of the french guests to be rather rude and irritating, ive never been to france so didn't realise how many of them smoke! many of them insisting on smoking in ques which is so selfish, especially when theres kids around, and not holding doors open for people with buggies which i am not used to as us brits do tend to have more manners i feel. one guy saw me struggling through a doorway and just barged past and let the door slam on me and my buggy  nice manners.Travelled via euro star and that was great, very convienant to disney land and its hotels and we stayed in disneys newport bay and found it to be convienant too as a lovely walk to parks, although the hotell is too big for us! so not personal attal, breakfast was not to our liking as continental.

Again, we were all disappointed! THEN, we are told NO fireworks over the castle either! Everything that makes a Disney experience complete was not there! So very disappointed!I know you probably don't care, you have millions of visitors daily, making millions of dollars daily but I just wanted to voice my feelings! We came 2000 miles for this experience! He never even got to SEE Mickey because he was in an area where he couldn't go with his cart! And because there was no welcome in the morning , no parade day or night, he never saw the characters her grew up with! I was very sad and disappointed for him and the rest of the group!

Some great rides in toy story land that we hadn't seen at other disney resorts. Generally the rides were a bit slower and tamer than other disney rides   but my boyfriend liked them (he is normally too scared to go on them!!)

Do less popular rides like Innoventions (in Disneyland) or Disney Animation (@ Hollywood Backlot in DCA) for a break...they were really fun for the kids.

We visited on a hot day and there isn't a lot of shade to hide from the sun and apart from buying a expensive drink there isn't anywhere to really cool down. So please remember to drink a lot and think of the weather before you head there. The park itself is great fun but the rides can build of up waiting times very quick so either be prepared or make use of the fast pass service. Also keep a eye on the characters because some of them will only be around for a limited time so don't miss people.

After a couple of days of fighting crowds in Paris, we called an audible and decided to go to Disneyland. We were so glad we did, we loved it. We read a lot of comments about the park being dirty, and we didn't find that to be the case at all. We actually felt it was on par with other DIsney parks, as far as cleanliness. The size of the park is small compared to Disneyland and Disneyworld. We went on a Friday and found the crowds to be smaller than we are accustomed to finding at Disney parks. There do appear to be a lot of rides that are closed (Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain part of the day, and others), I'm not sure if that is normal. Also, the fastpass system isn't great. There aren't a lot of rides that have fastpass, and so we just never really had much of an option to utilize this system. Overall, we had a great day and were so glad we went.

I've been at EuroDisney when it had just opened in 1992 with my parents   and I still remember playing with Goofy at breakfast and being Cinderella for some lovely days.Now it was just a day trip, we stayed at the Mercure Hotel in Bussy St Georges (which is just a 15mins train ride, and 2,50    away).One of the best things is the Dreams Show at closing time at the Disney Castle   it is magnificent and almost made me cry for pure pleasure listening to my favorite Disney songs and seeing those fireworks above the Castle   breathtaking!So, I'll be back for the Studios and when I've got kids, I'll go to Disneyland probably once a year at least   even if they don't like it;)) And by the way: I'm from Munich.

34894906,5,"missing","United States","We took our kids to Disneyland and California Adventure this summer. The boys (7 & 9) have asked to go there ever since they were little, thanks to the advertising on videos. We finally got the chance to take them and they had a great time! The rides were great, the shows were great, and the staff was always friendly and helpful. It really is a magical place!Probably my biggest criticism would be the crowds! We went July 13, 14, & 15, 2009, and there was no end to the lines! The best advice I can give is to be there early! DL opens at 8 and CA opens at 10   be there then and you will have the chance to ride the most popular rides without much waiting. Later in the day, you'll spend plenty of time waiting   even with the fastpass.One morning we used the magic morning option that came with our parkhopper tickets and arrived at 7 am   it was early, yes, but well worth it! We rode space mountain 3 times and the matterhorn once before the park even opened! Food and drinks here are expensive, so be prepared. We ate a big breakfast every day (we went to IHOP across the road one day and discovered it was REALLY high there, too   7.99 for the kids' breakfasts; go to the Coco's on Harbor & Chapman   it's MUCH more reasonable!), then brought waters and snacks (crackers & candy bars) to tide us over until the late afternoon. By then, the crowds were usually so bad that we left, ate an early supper, and rested until evening. By the way, evening crowds are horrific. I am surprised that one person even mentioned that they close the park when it's full to capacity   it sure didn't seem like it at night!!! You couldn't hardly move in the place! And stake out your place for the night shows early   at least an hour before. We didn't , and had trouble finding a place to watch   even though we showed up for Fantasmic 40 minutes early. People are rude, also, and will come and stand in front of you even though you have been waiting for a long time and they just walked up . . . be prepared; I was really ticked off by the number of people who pushed me and my kids around, trying to get in front of us for a better spot. However, I can't blame Disneyland for the decline of manners in America!!Souvenirs are really neat, though a little overpriced as well. I bought two t shirts   one for each of my kids. One is a youth sized shirt, and one a small adult size. I spent $47!! The t shirts are just regular shirts; not long sleeved, not embroidered, etc. I was also going to buy my kids a set of mouse ears for them to have as souvenirs   but they were $15 , so I passed. My kids, who had saved their own money, even shopped discriminately and mentioned how expensive the toys were. And trust me, my kids aren't great at saving money, so I was really surprised that they noticed how expensive things were. However, I took plenty of pics and plan on scrapbooking our trip, so that will make the best souvenir of all!As for the rides, our favorites at Disneyland were Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, the Haunted Mansion and Indiana Jones. The boys weren't impressed by It's a Small World, but we felt they HAD to ride it, just because. They also really liked Pirates of the Caribbean. They also enjoyed the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids show and the Innovations (Innoventions?) attraction at Disneyland.At California Adventure, California Screamin' was the favorite. It's quite a unique roller coaster ride that takes off in seconds   and never slows down until you stop. It has great dips and even a loop, but you really don't have time to anticipate what comes next and get nervous   it's over and done before you can think about it. My kids both enjoyed this, and the 7 year old was tall enough to ride it.The water ride here   I can't remember the exact name   was also a favorite. We got wet, but not soaked. My nine year old enjoyed the Tower of Terror, but it was a little much for the 7 year old   he cried after it was over, and he's my little dare devil, so be warned that it might be a little much for young children. There is a nice little section of rides just for young ones in CA, and the shows here are fantastic! We saw the It's a Bugs Life show (I can't remember the exact name again) as well as the Muppets in 3 D (twice), and Talking with Crush. There is also an Animator's Workshop in the building where the Crush show is   they teach you how to draw a cartoon character   very neat! My youngest and I have bad eyes and cannot usually see 3 D attractions   these are VERY well done, and we could see the special effects without any problems! All of these will be great for your kids!Finally, I can't go without mentioning the acapella group that sings in front of the theater on the Hollywood side of CA. I can't remember there name   the something Daddy os??? I'm not sure, but they are a wonderful quartet and sing some great oldies like  Under the Boardwalk  and  In the Still of the Night  and many others. I could have listened to them all day; they were really good. If you enjoy oldies, make sure to look for them!Despite the crowds and expense, my kids said this was their best vacation ever. My 7 year old even cried today when we left because he wanted to go back again and again . . . however, since we are from Oklahoma, that may have been his only visit! However, if it ever works out, we will consider taking him back, if only for the magic . . .","Disneyland_California"

There was a bar in the hotel called The Red Garter which was 6 Euro for a pint of lager and 4 Euro for a diet coke. TIP! Keep your till receipts, because if you spend over a certain amount, your recepit will have a voucher at the bottom for a free glass of pop. We found breakfasts very bad indeed. Firstly it was like a rugby scrum of a morning (mostly with the other french guests) who dont queue like the english! just to get your hands on something to eat   and then there's a terrible 'continental' selection. Only croissants, 3 types of very sweet cereal, and cheese and ham to make up sandwich rolls from! Rubbish coffee, no Tea so all that was left that was ok, was orange or pineapple juice. So you leave the breakfast area still feeling hungry. We walked the 10 minutes along the man made river to the park entrance, as the shuttle busses are usually jam packed, and it is actually a very nice, quiet, easy walk. DONT EAT in the Disney Village Area (this is where most of the big eating establishments are before you actually get to the park gates). The food here is VERY expensive with a burger costing anything from 17 Euro to 30 Euro! We took our own stock of crisps, biscuits, pot noodles etc following advice we had had from other people that had visited, and it was a good job we did or else we would have been starving. At the end of the holiday though, we were longing for a proper meal of meat and vegetables, as only junk food seems to be on offer in the resort   unless your willing to pay through the nose! Unfortunately for us, the Disney Magic was seriously lacking as we expected to see Disney characters walking around the parks, but no. If you want to see one, let along have your photo took with them, then you have to queue up in a designated location for nearly an hour to do this. Again the park rides fill up very fast and before you know it there's at least a 70 minute wait for them, let alone the popular ones! We had a nice bbq chicken meal in the frontierland   which only cost 27 Euro   this was after we scoured the park for the best deals. As I say, for us it was a let down. Just seemed to be a glorified Theme Park, which was not as large as expected, souvenier shops at every turn with as high a price as the food establishments, no characters to 'coo' over and very rude europeans to battle with.

Take the Tung Chung Line and get down at Sunny Bay station and from there take the dedicated Disneyworld train which runs every 10 minutes or so. Get there early. Because almost for all the rides you will have to wait in queue lasting anything between 20 minutes to 90 minutes. Sad part is except for Space Mountain and Mine train rest are lame even for kids as old as 8 years. Do take the river raft in adventure land, the lion king life show and the Astrobuzz ride. Its a fun experience for kids and adults alike. Rent a stroller because the kids will get tired after some time. You can rent them just after entering on left side of the main square at the fire station at 100 HKD for the day with an additional 100 HKD refundable security deposit. Do get in front of castle by 8:15 to 8:30 PM to see the fireworks scheduled at 9 PM everyday. A good idea will be to get food as take out and then eat while waiting for the show to begin.PhotoOps with characters   A must have for the kids. The challenge is that the queues for it are very long.

The live shows were absolutely amazing and worth the wait! I don't think it's necessary to be waiting exactly when they suggest but at least a 10min before the start of the show. *our wait times might be skewed because we went on a Wednesday on a very very hot June day (weather channel said it felt like 105oF the day we went).There are many good food options for people but there was only limited air conditioned seats so we opted to buy hotdogs from a stand and stayed under the shade for a quick bite to eat. Try the mango juice there, it tastes so good and is super refreshing on a hot day!We didn't get a chance to watch the parades  fireworks because it was so hot outside that we wanted to do all the rides and buy some souvenirs before heading back to our hotel.

Not cheap to get in but worth the money in my opinion.","Disneyland_California"
150386468,4,"2012-12","Canada","During our trip 5 6 it was the first time at Disneyland while 3 6 had previously been to Disneyworld. My first impression was wow, the customer service here is second to none. Everyone should have to work at Disney or Disney needs to branch out with customer service education. Everyone from the people working the rides to the people selling churos to the staff picking up litter and handing out park maps had the biggest smiles on their faces which gave off the feeling that they really enjoyed being there. It was completely refreshing. Heck even the security staff during the large fireworks show were smiling while working crowd control.The lineups for rides are a downer and takeaway from some of the experience when you can only have one Fastpass at a time.Everytime I turned around there were more strollers running over my ankles and also made it very difficult to get through stores when it started raining as they all headed for cover in the stores. If you're not a fan of incredibly large crowds and ridiculously long lines, I would suggest that you stay away at Christmas time even though the displays and parades are fantastic.The cutest sights without a doubt were all the little girls dressed up like fairies or princesses.","Disneyland_California"

But for me and my husband we went to Disney World in Florida for our honeymoon and the two parks were a completely different experience! First of all, Paris is a complete rip off, the food was terrible and the price of it was ridiculous, we ate the best of steak and crab cakes in Florida and it was for nothing, really great value, the people in Paris nearly fell into my child's pram and would overtake you in queues (really bad mannered) had no time for my child in the park and in Florida the people made the whole disney experience magical! I got on the train in Disneyland Paris, carrying my child, cases and a folded up buggy and the door automatically shuts, it shut on the backpack I was wearing and not one person on the train got up to help me they watched in their seats as my husband tried stepping over and avoiding falling over their suitcases they have blocking the aisles! I now have two children and would them to go back there and I probably would but I will know better than to expect help from anyone there! Scary experience at times but kids love it! And I would sacrifice the bad mannered people to have a happy child!","Disneyland_Paris"

I was looking forward to being the place Walt built and seeing main street and seeing the castle and sadly it had so much construction you couldn't see it. I did enjoy riding rides only at Disneyland that Walt had his hand in. He still made it family friendly, but you could tell how he didnt expect it to grow like it did because the wait lines areas where very short and the rides where on the smaller side but still available for anyone of any size. I expect in summer or fall months it would look better when they were doing major construction. We would see characters but they always said the line was already too long, so I suggest being there before the character is suppose to be around and be the first few in line or you won't get to see them. Restrooms were clean and so was the park. My husband and I still had lots of fun. Make sure you allow time for parking in the garage its $20 and then you go thru a medical dector and then load on to a tram and then you get to the park. So allow enough time in the morning. Lastly have fun and watch where your walking. :)","Disneyland_California"

While we were expecting it not to measure up because of the smaller size, we were pleasantly surprised and still racked up ten mile days. The two parks and downtown areas are compact but large enough to keep us busy for several days. It was nice to be able to walk from our hotel, located ten minutes away, right into the parks. Another plus in comparison to Florida, the August weather in California is so nice that no rain ponchos were required and the ride wait times were modest. Disneyland uses the old fast pass method. Some of the rides are the same as Disney World, but many are different and it was fun seeing that as we walked around. Downtown Disney has great shopping and dining options and even though restaurants were very busy, the wait times were reasonable. We hope to return, soon!","Disneyland_California"

Arrived at 10 in the morning, and parking and entry, etc. is all well organised and easy to find.And although we had a good time, the kids loved their real first experiences of some roller coaster, and we did all of them besides the splash mountain that had 70 minutes waiting times, I couldn't leave at the end of the day feeling I had paid to much for this day.For some reason you leave Universal Studios with a more satisfied feeling. Maybe its the age of the Disneyland and its attractions. Glad I didn't book a whole week or 3  days in it. I may come back to try the adventure part of it one day, but I think a day was enough for us to get a feel for it.P. S.: Although busy, it wasn't crazy busy.

A touch of 'la fromage' but if you let yourself get into it and see it as pure entertainment you'll love it. Main Street, and it's awesome vista towards the castle, is essentially one massive Disney store. If you think you will make it out of the park without buying anything for the kids, then think again! Rides are great   lots of variety but a lot of queuing   unavoidable but so you know.... Don't miss the Frozen show of you liked the movie!Lunch time is a challenge especially in the summer when it is so packed. Suggest having snacks as backup in case there are no restaurant spaces or buffet queues are long. If you have daughters who love Princesses, then book a table in 'L'Auberge de Cendrillon' to meet Cinderella and possibly a few others princesses if you are lucky!! Its food and service is the most premium that we experienced in DisneyLand. If you or your kids love Mickey and friends, book ahead to Mickey Caf  . Great fun, good close interaction with the Disney 'heroes', but food needs a lot of work.... Finally, wear trainers. It is workout in disguise.

This was not the case at all and the park proved to be busier than ever. Our biggest complaint though was that Disney has allowed the park itself to fall into such a sad state. The whole property needs a makeover. Even a coat of fresh paint would go a long way in restoring the Disney sparkle. The other thing that is frustrating is that people don't know how to handle lines at this park. In Florida or Anaheim, cueing is a much easier thing   here chaos runs rampant the moment a character emerges. Instead of waiting for one's turn, the people hit the poor guy from every direction so that even if you have been in  line  longer, you may not be guaranteed to get to Mickey, Minnie, etc. Very frustrating!","Disneyland_Paris"

6745751,5,"missing","Australia","Disneyland ParkOne of the few places in the world where everyone must visit at least once in their life time. And yet whether you   re 5 years old or 50 years old, you can be sure that there is something for everyone. From thrill seeking rollercoaster   s (your choice of indoors, outdoors, or both!) to peaceful steamboats cruising the lake, Disneyland, despite its age, keeps bringing people of all ages, from all around the world back year after year after year. The larger and older of the 2 parks in Anaheim, the Disneyland Park is not showing any signs of deterioration with rides very regularly refurbished and the kept grounds meticulously spotless by the ever cheerful staff to make it the happiest place in the universe. Lookout for the new Finding Nemo submarine ride, opening in the 1st half of 2007; another sign that Disney is keeping up with the times.Specific rides that are a must see are Indiana Jones (an adventure in a desert truck through dark caves), Space Mountain (the fast paced, futuristic indoor rollercoaster) and Pirates of the Caribbean (a journey through a pirates life including the battle scenes to the drunk scenes). Note that these rides are not for the faint hearted     look for the warnings at the front of each ride.For a comprehensive tour around the Disneyland park, take a trip from Main Street on the Disneyland Railroad train, with regular stops on the way as you steam roll around the entire circumference of the park. Also, take a fun and leisurely cruise down a lake filled with exotic animals on the Jungle Cruise where you may see more than 1 kind of elephant along the way.A trip to Disneyland is not complete without watching the world famous street parade along main street. Once staff begin to rope off the pedestrian area, take a seat in a prime position along the roadside for an energetic Disney themed parade with all of the classic characters. During the festive season, Santa even makes a visit.At 9:30pm every night of the year (weather permitting), Disney treats guests to a fireworks extravaganza, which can be seen and heard from all around Anaheim. A shooting star initiates a colourful array as Mickey   s face lights up the sky. If staying in a hotel, the best view is arguably in a room at the Hilton Anaheim, with a front row seat of the action from the comfort of your own room.Disneyland is infamous of long lines which can be particularly tedious in the hot summer months or cold winter months. To minimise this waiting time, come to Disneyland during a weekday, some time during the school term. With Disneyland Bonus Hopper passes (3 days or longer), 1 of those days allows the ticket holder entry to the park 1 hour before the general public. This is particularly handy if you already know which rides you want to jump on first, to avoid the long lines. Note however that not all of the park and rides are open during the early entry hour; notable most of the western side of the park. In addition to this, Disney has introduced a new system called a FastPass, where guests have the ability on selected rides to swipe their entry passes and receive a reservation card. So all they have to do is come back at the time printed on the card and go right to the front of the queue. Excellent if you   re about to go for lunch so you can come back and jump straight onto the ride.Disneyland is not a cheap last minute attraction, where some people from Australia plan to see Disneyland first, while the rest of the USA is second in importance. Being a one of a kind, Disney rarely offers discounted tickets to distributors, so the most chance of scoring cheaper tickets is through Disney direct. They currently have adults at kid   s prices if you visit in the 1st half of this year, where a 3 day bonus hopper pass is currently $US129 per adult (far cheaper than what a Sydney travel agent can offer). If you buy the tickets only 31 days before your visit, you   ll also save on the international courier needed to send tickets to Australia (you   ll be able to pick them up there   Will Call). Note that a 1 day pass will not enable entry into both parks on the same day. Ideally to visit both parks comprehensively, depending on the number of people in the park, a 3 day bonus hopper pass is ideal (one park each day, the 3rd day split between the 2). Disney   s California Adventure ParkJust a few years old, Disney   s California Adventure Park was built to resemble a mini California of fun. While smaller than its larger, older brother, DCA is for the thrill seekers, with the famous California Screamin    rollercoaster at Paradise Pier. Disney   s attempt at recreating California has not come without critics, but if in doubt, take a flying tour at Soarin    over California where you realistically take off around California   s most famous areas. This is one of the most popular rides with waiting times of over 1 hour, so do it first!Paradise Pier is a great place to grab an ice cream, as you really do feel like you   re on a carnival filled pier facing the ocean, while you watch the California Screamin    rollercoaster zoom around the circumference of huge Mickey   s face. Another unseemingly blood rushing ride is the Sun Wheel, and while guests can take the traditional ferris wheel ride, most take the swinging carriage side which freely swings toward the centre and outward of the giant wheel, of course with no seat belt restraints.It   s tough to be a bug! (A Bug   s Life) is also a must see 4D show which includes the sense of touch.

I was shocked to see so many rides and attractions closed   the magic really was not there when you arrive to boards up and major attractions closed.

342487846,5,"2016-1","United States","Tips to enjoy Disneyland:1. Go early and take advantage of less crowds and nether parking options. 2. Take advantage of Fast pass by getting passes for those, rides first. 3. Decide what are the must see shows rides attractions and plan around those. 4. The monorail takes you from downtown disney to tomorrow land. Nice if you want to step out for a meal in downtown disney or cou k do be easier access to the park.5. Know that some rides can still be scary for little ones even if they meet the height requirement. So use your best judgment knowing your kid's personality the best. 6. Pack snacks and bring a refillable water bottle   food is pricey and if you and your kiddos want something a little healthier, beat that you being it with you.7. Check out where different characters come out so you can meet your favorite princess, Mickey, Winnie the Pooh, etc.8. Bring a stroller for your little ones. They will get tired and overly excited. Prepare for a meltdown at the happiest place on earth!!","Disneyland_California"

If you don   t like wiring for everything and I mean everything then this place is not for you. If you can handle the cues then you can have a great time. I recommend arriving at least 45 minutes prior to any show starting to assure you will get in. Most characters are at leat a 30 minute wait but Mickey and Minnie are about 1 1.30 hours. The princess pavilion is always always busy and we did not see a cue time less than 75 minutes. I would highly recommend the lunch with princesses as this way you get to see about 4 princesses without the waiting around. We watched buffalo bills Wild West show which was expensive but really good. The food was cornbread and chilli to start then a chicken leg two ribs and sausage with baby potatoes for main and a lovely apple dessert and ice cream for dessert then coffee also a choice of coke beers or water which they refill three times.","Disneyland_Paris"

Parking was 17 usd and in the full sun. and there was an convenient shuttle to the park which was already fun. Getting an entry ticket was slow. After waiting for some time in the full sun someone approached us with the message to go to another booth on the other side of the square. This was very unclear though. Finally we managed to get to pay 200USd for 2 tickets    Entering the park it looked very busy. Well this was an understatement. The park was old and small. Everything was very close to each other and there were just to many people inside the park. Busy is not an issue you expect that. However this was just plain madness. To the point of just dangerous full.Waiting time was minimum of 1,5 hours. You could hardly walk so many people were inside the park. We were so disappointed that we decided to leave after 1 hour . we issued an complaint and I must say they gave us back most of the fees we paid to get in. If you want to go to Disney go to Florida.

337050677,4,"2015-12","Australia","Had a great time booking a 3 day pass with one early morning.We used the fast pass option where we could. The fast pass option is on the more popular rides which means you can gate a fats pass which takes you to the a different line between a specified period. So you go to a ride with the fast pass machine say 10:20am and the machine will spit out a fast pass ticket for whatever times are available for example 10:50 11:50am. So you just go between these times in the fast pass line. You can only get 1 fast pass at a time between the fast pass times. But you can go between the 2 parks and have multiple fast passes.The Cars ride has a very long line and getting a fast pass say at 9am could result in the fast pass being say 2 3pm ticket, and in some cases if you go after 10am may not get a fast pass at all as they would be gone for the whole day.For some rides there is the normal line, fast pass line, and the single rider line which is used to fill in the spare seats on popular rides.And I have never seen so many mobility scooters in my life, someone told me people hire someone who by law has handicap ticket and a scooter and they use these people to go to front of line for every ride like a VIP pass...... very sad state of affairs. Food is very expensive in these parks, a hotdog which is 4 inches long cost $8.","Disneyland_California"

And consulting my surgeon and physio we decided to book a 4night stay at disneyland paris for myself, wife and 4year old son.when we arrived at the hotel (newport bay club) the person checking us in said to go to the city halls in the park where I would get a pass to help access the rides due to my condition.so the next morning thats where we went, only to be told that I had to have a note from my doctor stating what was wrong with me (the staff must be blind as I am hobbling about with a cruch and a knee like an american football!) So I contacted the hospital to c if they could fax a letter across and spent the first morning trying to get round the rides and at about 12:00 in a lot of pain decided to go back to the hotel to rest and couldnt face going back so decided to go back the next day.the next day I went to the city hall and spoke to the customer service representative who said no fax had came through and again hobbled round the park wait in the queues for upto an hour and a quarter then when the pain got so bad about 12:30 went back to the hotel and tryed to contact the hospital to get a fax.on the third day same again.but when we got back the receptionist said I should ask fot the manager which I did and finally the guy on the desk took a look at my knee and said he would give me the access card which was great as I could get on the rides etc why could they not have done that at the start and not wasted our holiday and a lot of money. wouldn't recommend this if you have a disability or are recovering from surgery .very disappointed with the whole experience at the parks but would recommend the hotel.","Disneyland_Paris"

The chaos may be partly to blame for the massive amount of construction and overhaul the park is currently undergoing. It is difficult to understand why decisions to close some bathroom facilities for rehab while not providing additional options were made. Closing down the train that moves people from one side of the park to the other is also a very bad move. People can barely get around most hours of the day and several ride closures complicated things further. There aren't enough places for people to sit and rest and the fast pass system is antiquated and there isn't a system in place to allow people to exchange a pass if a ride breaks during their allotted time. The situation during the parade times is dangerous. There is absolutely no way an emergency situation can be handled.

What theme park manages to take in hundreds of thousands of people daily, trample over, litter and trash the place, and still keep everything looking and smelling brand spanking new? For 60 years, Disneyland has and still does.Disney is such a quality organization, and they do it right in all aspects of their business. As a former cast member in the gaming industry, I know first hand the many depths that Disney goes to be superior to their competitors. They make things right for the consumer, babying them, treating them right, making them feel like a kid, and surrounding them with bright colorful shiny toys, colorful lights lights and more lights , spectacular fireworks and entertainment , heart touching sounds, childhood memories, disney characters come to life , exciting attractions, yummy food , you name it. Disney gets into your brain and right into your heart. It's no wonder that billions visit Disney every year; no matter how much a family may struggle financially, they will still manage to take the kids to Disneyland at $100 a pop.Famously known for it's overpriced food, Disneyland seems to have recently made food items more affordable (or at least they seem more normal due to inflation), and rightly so, with the hundreds of thousands of people that pass through their gates daily, at $100 pop entrance fee, they make an additional slaughter off food and memorabilia.

Additionally, prices are ridiculous   how can an average, working class family afford to pay $32 for four hot dogs and four small bags of chips  no drink included?!?

It has a magical attraction both for children and adults. I love the whole vibe, with the music playing, the nice shops and the overall buzz of happiness.The park itself is beautiful. Everything is very well maintained and the flowers and trees look amazing.When I compare to previous years I did notice that some of the attractions are in need of some TLC. This resulted in some of them breaking down during the day for an hour or so. We got lucky when they just re opened the Space Mountain in front of us and we stormed in like idiots to get the first ride     Unfortunately afterwards Big Thunder Mountain broke down just when we were about to cash in our Fast Pass. Fast Passes are great by the way. Just plan your visit a little and you can avoid the waiting lines on most big rides. The only one we actually queued for was the Pirates of the Caribbean. The Disney Studios are not as crowded as Disney itself and we only headed to the main park after 6 o   clock when it started to calm down. The food quality has definitely improved (both in the parks and Disney Village  over the last couple of years. I remember it being horrible at first, it was better last time but this time they really got it right (after 20 years). I know some people complain about the prices in the restaurants and the shops. If you want a cheap weekend getaway this is not the place to go. This is to get the Disney experience but it   ll cost ya.Finally, I see some people have mentioned that you don   t see as much Disney figures in the park as you used to.

485486056,5,"2017-5","United States","There are 21,000  reviews of the  Happiest Place on Earth , so I guess that I'll try to keep this one centered around our specific experience to help those folks attempting a similar trip. My wife and I stayed several blocks south of the park with our two children (girl   3 yo, boy   5 yo) and intended to do a 3 day single park pass to Disneyland. And we intended to get our money's worth, so if you   re go getters, this is the review for you.I   ll break the review up by topic: Getting Around, Rides, Events, Characters, Food, and Important Notes at the end.Getting Around:We arrived early on Saturday, dropped our gear at the hotel, and walked the several blocks to Downtown Disney, the shopping plaza between the two parks. We did this mostly to get a reconnaissance of where the entry gates were, and to get familiar with the distance to the park and travel time. Downtown Disney has a fun feel to it, but as my son said, very disappointed, on the walk back to the hotel,  That was Disneyland? . This was the second reason we went, to see how the kids reacted to the crowd, followed directions, and handled that much Mickey Mouse. No son, that was the appetizer.Bring rent a stroller. I can   t emphasize this enough. My wife and I went back and forth on this. I was worried about maneuvering, leaving the stroller behind, packing it, etc. I finally gave in to my wife's (better) judgement and boy am I glad we did. Our youngest could have walked, but would have slowed us down considerably. The stroller sped her up, worked as additional storage, and stroller parking is as easy as dumping your stroller on any unoccupied wall. If we could have done a standup kickboard on the back, that would have been ideal, as in addition to transporting the kids, it was nice to keep them close and under control as the crowd can easily sweep away kids. I was worried about thieves, but apparently, the only concern for strollers was if the Disney  stroller attendants  consolidate your stroller further away than where you left it. An identifying marker on your stroller is a great idea. To the family with the flashing LED rope, you shame us all with your ingenuity. Seeing as we only had one stroller and that we would be making the four times daily (coming back for naps) we decided to get an ART (Anaheim Resort Transit) 3 day pass. For the entire family, it was $34. Score. The bus picked up at the convention center near our hotel, you could text for bus arrival times, and it was a straight shot to the park. Easy peasy. That being said, there were some negatives. Make sure to inquire as to any delays (accidents, construction, marathons, etc.). On the day of our magic morning, there was construction, which took us a roundabout way, to sit 15 minutes at a broken light. Long story short, our extra hour was cut significantly short. I would highly recommend communicating with transit ahead of time where timeliness is important.Getting into the Downtown Disney and Park Entrance areas, there are several security lines. Have your bag ready for a quick scan and be ready for some long lines. Security moves far faster than the ticket entry lines, so be sure to come at least 30 minutes early if you   re hoping to get in when the park opens. There are ticket vendors here as well, but do the smart thing and buy your tickets in advance. See the Disney App note below. You   ll have plenty of time to wait in lines so why practice here. Rides:We charged into the park to do battle with the masses in pursuit of nostalgia and sunburns! Our plan was to conquer Fantasyland and Toon Town first. For those of you that might not be familiar with your DL geography, Fantasyland is where all of the acid trip rides from the beginning are kept: Toad's Wild Ride, Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio, etc. These rides can be a little intense as they're very dark, very jerky, chances are your kids haven't seen the movies, and they're extremely loud, flashy, and a tad creepy. We did all of these once just to cross them off the list and move on. Toon Town has all of the character houses as well as a couple smaller rides and shops. The most critical piece for us here was Gadget's Go Coaster. That's everyone's favorite female mouse from Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers. It's so important because our children had not been initiated into the world of roller coasters as of yet, and this one is approximately 10 seconds long, all open air, and over before your kid knows that it started. This was a good barometer for us to gauge how the kids would do with the rest of the rides. Spoiler; they loved it. I won't review each of the rides individually, but I'll give you some rankings that I think are important as far as the kids are concerned. Scaredy Cat Level: Storybook Land Canal, King Arthur's Carousel, Casey Jr. train, Small World, Jungle Cruise, Character Houses, Winny the Poo, and Tarzan's Treehouse. Enjoys Danger Only If Tucked into Your Armpit Level: Dumbo, Teacups, Alice in Wonderland, Buzz Lightyear, Autotopia, and the  acid trip  rides mentioned earlier.Hangs Upside Down from the Monkey Bars Level: Gadget's Go Coaster, Star Tours, Astro Orbiter, and Pirates of the Caribbean. (maybe haunted mansion?)Throw Me Higher, Daddy Level: Splash Mountain, Thunder Mountain, Matterhorn, Space Mountain, and the rest. My kids are by no means thrill seekers, and they attempted every ride at least once. My 5 year old son and I even did the Matterhorn and Thunder Mountain twice. Events:There were a variety of non ride options for entertainment at the park. Between the parades and shows, there were hours of activities to attend. We saw Mickey and the Magical Map which was a very entertaining 30 40 minutes of Disney inspired music and dancing. There is a ton of seating here so don   t worry about arriving early. We also saw a small scale play rendition of Beauty and the Beast at the Royal Theater which was very entertaining with plenty of stich to go around.We saw two parades while we were in attendance and there are specific strategies here. The electrical parade happens twice nightly and rotates around the fireworks (if there are fireworks). It goes from Small World to the main gate first, and then returns for the second showing. Either way you see it, make sure you aren   t chasing it or you   ll miss out. The electrical parade was a ton of fun and I highly recommend it if your kids can stay up. The Mickey   s Soundsational Parade was also very enjoyable, and we got to see almost all of the characters. We had done a princess meet and greet and only had seen two. During the parade, we saw six different princesses and some pretty impressive floats to boot! Seating for the parades starts getting taken up several hours before the parades (I   m not sure why   ) but depending on the size of your party, you can typically find a spot minutes before the parade begins. The main street and central plaza fill up first and then seating fills up radiating out from there. We screwed up a little bit with the fireworks display. We started by watching them closer to Frontierland and the Royal Theater, and then tried to run over to New Orleans Square, before breaking down and heading back towards the central plaza. I hear that there is an amazing view of the fireworks from Small World. The central plaza is definitely the winner though, as you   re able to see all of the light shows projected on the castle as well as the matterhorn. Very fun and I would argue a must if you are visiting. If you   ve either already seen the parades fireworks or they just aren   t your thing, now is a critical time for racking up some ride time. Certain rides will shut down, but many stay open. Find out which are which ahead of time and you   ll bag a couple extra trips down Splash Mountain. Trials of the Jedi Temple is the jedi training program for your 4 12 year old. You can find the signup location behind the Launch Bay near the Autotopia ride. Get there EARLY. As in the first thing you do before you consider Peter Pan. These spots go very quickly, and the shows run throughout the day. I imagine it supports 80 100 kids a day, which may seem like a lot    but those spots were gone quick. Your padawan gets a robe and a lightsaber, and goes on stage to practice their lightsaber skills, and eventually fight a Sith warrior. This is a must do, and the pro togs get some great photos. Try to wrap this into your photopass day if you can.Food:Sunday morning, we went to Goofy's Kitchen, which is a character breakfast that we reserved via the Disneyland iPhone application well, well, well in advance. The Goofy's Kitchen character breakfast was a buffet style breakfast with a specific Goofy photo op at the entrance and several characters randomly parading around and doing table visits. We saw Goofy, Pluto, Chip, Dale, and Minnie. The price for 2 and 2 (adults kids) was $150. The meal was ultimate kid fare: mickey shaped waffles and pancakes, lots of breakfast pastries and desserts, omelet bar, fruit, Euro style meat and cheese selections, and Goofy's signature Peanut Butter and Jelly Pizza. There were even some more lunch y, comfort options if you had a later reservation (or picky kiddos) such as chicken strips, macaroni and cheese, etc. When we left the meal, I was fairly disappointed. For the price, we had three characters come to the table for a quick hug and photo op, the pictures the pro tog (professional photographer) took at the beginning were offered up for sale in a collectible folder for something like $39, and the food was nothing to write home about. Rough start to the trip. One upside was the chef did come out to discuss the food options and what we should avoid to keep our son safe from any nut contamination. This goes a long way, to see someone of importance go the extra mile and personally make sure everyone is safe. My overall assessment is to skip this breakfast and save the money for something else. I would have applied the $150 to three days of photopasses. We also made a reservation for the Blue Bayou (well in advance). This is the restaurant INSIDE the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, and I found it to be worth every penny. I arrived about 30 minutes ahead of my reservation and requested a waterside table and was obliged. The food was absolutely amazing. Disney also does a great job balancing kid   s meals so you don   t feel like you   re just packing their colons with crap. They also do this handy little thing where they bring your kids some veggies and dip before the meal. I   m sure your pack of hyenas will be as hungry as mine, so this is a major victory for Disney dining. We ordered two kids meals and a pair of Monte Cristo   s. The kid   s meals were considerable portions and the Monte Cristo   s were boxed and made a trip home as well, given their size. There was a gumbo and house salad that came with the meals and were likewise delectable. The final bill was around $130 which I felt was acceptable. Did I mention the bottomless NA Mint Juleps?Moving around the park, there are plenty of carts vendors and smaller cafes. We tried nearly everything and I will conclude that you will make your dollar go much further if you eat in the cafes as opposed to the carts. $9.50 for a corndog sounds good when you   re starving, but you can get a delicious steak gumbo bread bowl for $11 or so, and this was far more filling. Another delicious value item was the Chicken Tostada Salad at Rancho Del Zocalo ($12). I think this may have been my favorite splurge. The corndog was good, the popcorn smells amazing, and the churros were alright but you   re going to pay out the wazoo for each and be hungry at the end. The turkey leg was surprisingly filling and worth its value. Our family of four ate at it for 10 minutes or so before giving up the ghost. A nice protein kick for our carbo loaded visit.Dole whips. This is the pineapple craze that is worth the rave reviews in my humble opinion. The dole whip or Dole float, you can   t go wrong. The line can be long, but I   ll let you in on a secret; walk into the Tiki Hut and there is a second bar on the other side that is hardly noticed. Now take the time you saved and go ride Thunder Mountain again. You   re welcome.Disney food aside, it was surprising how lenient the park was about bringing in your own food and beverages. Bring water bottles for certain unless you consider bottles of water at $3.50 apiece to be a reasonable sum. Snacks are a must, and if you can hold off past normal meal hours, you could bring in more substantial food and grab a spot for the parade while you grub up. Characters:This was a little bit confusing, and another reason to definitely get the Disney App. The Disney application will show you which characters are going to be in the park that day, as well as their exact location and what time they are expected to appear. This is nice so you can coordinate your rides with the respective areas. The less than ideal part is the character lines. We waited in the location of a princess appearance, and suddenly Rapunzel and Flynn appeared (my daughter   s favorite) and folks started gathering around her. We had been there 10 15 minutes and blanched when she walked to the far side of the little area and we were told that the meeting line was already closed by her attendant. We managed to negotiate our way into the line because someone decided to step out rather than wait.The story we were given was that as opposed to having signage or waiting areas, the character appearances are fairly random. They   ll just grab a nearby onlooker as the start of the line, stack up 15 or 20 people, and then close off the appearance to all others. To be successful here, be in the area, follow the attendant, and don   t be afraid to hold your ground. The only locations that didn   t seem to follow this rule was the several Star Wars characters in the Launch Bay for Star Wars. Notes:**Note  1   The Disneyland app is ESSENTIAL. Buy your tickets on it, link your photopass, make your reservations VERY early, and become familiar with all it has to offer. We used every function on the app short of finding the nearest defibrillator. **Note  2   Bring rent a stroller. My wife and I went back and forth on this. I was worried about maneuvering, leaving the stroller behind, packing it, etc. I finally gave in to my wife's (better) judgement and boy am I glad we did. Our youngest could have walked, but would have slowed us down considerably. As well, when one of the kids would collapse from exhaustion, the stroller allowed us to carry on. The stroller sped her up, worked as additional storage, and stroller parking is as easy as dumping your stroller on any unoccupied wall. I was worried about thieves, but apparently, the only concern for strollers was if the Disney  stroller attendants  consolidate your stroller further away than where you left it. An identifying marker on your stroller is a great idea. To the family with the flashing LED rope, you shame us all with your ingenuity.**Note  3     Some rides are better at night, especially if you want to do them over and over again. When we did splash mountain at 11 on Sunday, people were literally staying in the same logs and riding back to back to back. There   s also a new level of terror during Thunder Mountain when you can   t see anything throughout the ride ala Space Mountain. We never did Finding Nemo during the day, but found it spectacular at night. There   s also little better time to capitalize on short lines than during the parades or fireworks (if the rides are open). **Note  4     Research the photopass. There are pro togs everywhere and around most of the characters. The characters will move quickly, as will your kids, and those magic moments will pass by quicker than your iPhone will keep up. I have some very nice professional camera gear and consider myself a pro tog, but I didn   t want to lug around my camera on our trip. I was kicking myself after the first couple of days. On the third day, I finally looked into the photo pass and realized you get ALL of the photos for the day for one fixed price. An amazing deal considering single photos of your family screaming on Splash Mountain cost the same. Budget for the photo pass, make that your character visit day, and let the pros handle the heavy lifting.**Note  5     Put your phone on battery saver mode and bring a portable phone charger if you can. If you   re an iPhone user like me and it doubles as your camera, then this should be your MO. We were very successful with this. **Note  6     Set up    Find My Phone    for your device. If you   re tall like me, it means your knees are frequently in your chin on some of the smaller rides. This made my wallet and phone constantly fall out of my pocket. At one point, I actually lost my phone for the better part of half a day. By the time I realized it wasn   t in the room, I was able to pull it up on Find My Phone, and track it to the exact bus it had fallen out on. Big shout out to the ART team here for their stellar integrity and phone rescuing skills.**Note  7     Forget going to Peter Pan first. Every blog says go to Peter Pan first, so naturally, everyone does. Unless you   re able to be the first 10 20 people in line, it will always be a 20 40 minute wait. Wait for the middle of the day when all of the rides are heavy, and do your time then.**Note  8     Fastpass, Fastpass, Fastpass. As soon as you use a fastpass, grab another fastpass. This is going to help you exponentially on the rides that fill up quick, which is all of the mountain rides. If you get a fastpass that is for later in the day, remember that you can grab another set of fastpasses at the time on the bottom of your ticket, usually two hours later. Fastpasses do run out, so be sure to get to them as fast as you can.**Note  9     If you do decide to wait in line for Peter Pan, don   t be afraid to leave brave old mom or dad to Facebook alone on their phone for 30 minutes while you run to two or three rides with 5 minute waits. We did this frequently as it seemed to be the norm. All of the switchbacks in line make it easy for your party to hope a rope or chain towards the end to join their party. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you enjoy your visit!","Disneyland_California"

Smoking everywhere,now I am a smoker and I was even offended at people lighting up beside me at meal times(we were outside but still ). IT IS EXPENSIVE,even if your kids stay and play for free,they need food and drink through the day unless you plan on starving them,the shops merchandise is over priced and its the same stuff in each shop,there were no where near enough characters in the parks.The toilets stank,not what I ever expected in a Disney park. Disneyland Paris workers need to take a few Disney courses,learn how to smile,make you feel wanted.

I went to City Hall Guest service and they let me call from Hong Kong back to Finland for free! Thank you so much for that! It was so helpful and kind, cause I was travelling solo and couldn't contact Finnair online, which was really annoying. There were no lines on that day which was really great, but a bit sad was that not all the restaurant were open and they even opened land one by one. So after park opened you still needed to wait until they open all lands.I loved the shows especially Mickey and the Wondrous Book and I loved it that they actually sang by themselves! And the Festival of Lion King too.Halloween parades were quiet short if you compare to other parades, which was a little minus and also even if staff at Guest Service were really helpful and didn't find customer service overall at the Park as good as at Shanghai Disneyland.

The buildings and props are fabulous and you really feel like you are in a different country. There are plenty of rides for little children and more vigorous rides for older children and adults. Fast passes are needed for Thunder mountain as this is a very busy ride, probably because it is excellent. Space mountain, Pirates of the caribbean and the Indiana Jones rides often have lulls in the queues so they can be pretty quick (5 minutes!) But in the busy periods you can get Fast passes for Space mountain and Indiana Jones. If you have small children   use the baby switch option too. Still too much smoking in the park (though better than last time we were there)The new firework and light display on the castle after the main parade at night is absolutely amazing. The use of the water curtains to project images is incredible and the music, fire and fireworks make it very spectacular. Quite a magical place for both children and adults.","Disneyland_Paris"

From those that are portraying a character all the way to the groundskeepers. Each one of them is there to make your day better and to show you kindness. There is such a remarkable difference because of the attitude of the staff. The grounds are kept meticulously clean and everyone is so kind.

182087200,4,"2013-10","United States","I knew as soon as I booked a holiday to Hong Kong that I would have to visit this park. Public transport was much like Tokyo Disneyland and easily accessible with the MTR system.I chose to attend on a Tuesday since I figured the park would not be too crowded. I showed up a little after opening time and there was a minimal wait for ticketing and security. Most of the rides only had a few minutes' wait. Winnie the Pooh was a popular ride, as well as Mad Hatter's Teacups. I recommend using the FastPasses for if you like a ride. Other than that, the most wait time I saw was twenty minutes.Some visitors might be underwhelmed by the architecture of the park. I actually had a flashback to Disneyland Paris (Main Street is almost the same). However, the castle is not as big as expected, but I still had a wonderful time. The Hong Kong engineers created the park to stimulate a 4D effect which was quite unique (such as smells or wind gusts).I would recommend checking beforehand to see if there are any public holidays because the park can fill up quick   it is not a sprawling attraction like the other Disney parks.

Many of the rides (Big Thunder Mountain, Rockin Rollercoaster, Tower of Terror,and Space Mountain) were superior to the similar rides in Orlando. The lines were generally very long. but times quoted at the start of the line were accurate. Our longest wait was 90 minutes for Ratatouille.The things that bothered us during our day at the park was that there were no characters walking around, and, the general cleanliness of the park was not up to the Disney standard. Other than that, a great place to visit. I wish we had another day!","Disneyland_Paris"
490106661,5,"2017-6","United States","We went to see the electric light parade before it  goes away forever . We bought a 3 day park hopper pass, which I highly recommend the park hopper. It's nice to be able to see it all whilst you are there. The parade was fantastic and followed directly by fireworks. All big! All fantastic. Disney does it all with style. Must see. Best seats are along Main Street on the right facing the castle. The fireworks seem to be shot off to the left of the castle and were obscured behind trees the second night we were there. The closer you are to the castle the better. Lots of crowds at Disney  and interestingly enough   most everyone open and friendly. People coming from all over America and the world to visit here and they love to talk! The rides can have quite long lines, which is tiring on your feet. One must, in advance, work out a strategy for the fast pass and single rider lanes. Fast Passes are issued every two hours at a minimum; so set the timer on your watch and send one of your crew with to collect them while the others hold your spot in line. You can get the fast passes sooner if your entrance time is sooner... Singlet rider line is great, most times and particularly if there is a long queue. You will wait the whole time with your companion, just not ride the one two minute adventure with them. Not perfect for teenagers in love or families with very young children   otherwise they only option for us. Food was decent overall. Easy enough to bring your own if you are local. Disney doesn't restrict what you can bring into the park for food. There are lockers for rent if you want to store it for later and not have to carry it around. Sometimes lockers go quick. Highly recommend and for multiple days if you can manage it. ","Disneyland_California"

Many of the rides we wanted to go on were broke down when we tried to ride them. Splash Mountain, Indian Jones, Space Mountain, just to name a few. Some of the staff I could see were not happy to be there, but then there were others that it showed. I guess I just have higher expectations for disneyland than I should, but at the same time, it's disney, come on! If you do not have kids, you can do this all in one day. If you have kids, you may need more time. However, despite all the negative things, we still had an amazing time and throughly enjoyed our time.

We loved Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain much more than their counterparts in Florida. They were awesome. My only complaint is that things were broken a lot. The Matterhorn was closed the entire time we were there. We were really disappointed, since that is not available in FL. We were lucky that Indiana Jones opened the last day we went.

Space mountain was the highlight of my trip. Do do do do do go to space mountain. Phanton tower was also uique and was something that can happen only in disnelyland Other 'disney' inspired ride was pirates of Caribbean that i totally adored (donot miss that) If you like cute rides then peterpan, snowhite, pockimon were also good and should be done. Sleep beauty castle, tree house and garden was also worth seeing.  The amazing and beautiful laser and fireworks show on the castle at 11pm. What I dint like? Expensive food. yes do carry your snack with you. One burger will cost you 7 euro For rides there were huge lines all thanks to stupid managing people. We stand in line for 1 hour and they say  we are sorry we have technical faults, but that is a mere a lie. All they want is that people leave the queue so that they have shorter line.

The hotel is plush with all modern amenities. Very nice ambience. This hotel does not have room service. Hence all meals have to be taken at the hotel's resturants. There are 3 of them. Chef Mickey (buffet resturant) is the best and serves limited indian dishes. It is also very expensive. One meal for 2 adults and one child can cost around 950 hkd. For those who savour non vegetarian food, chef mickey is a delight....the non veg spread is quite elaborate. The breafast at chef mickey is more economical. The indian vegetarian options are limited at breakfast as well. Infact it is the same daal makhani, steam rice, laccha paratha combination that you can expect during breakfast, lunch as well as dinner at chef mickey. We had one breakfast and one dinner at chef mickey. We tried out 2 dinners and one lunch at studio lounge ( ala carte resturant) at hollywood hotel. It offered the same indian vegetarian dishes as chef mickey but at half the cost (for 2 adults and 1 child). Each meal cost us around 500hkd at studio lounge. One thing we must mention, the daal makhani preparation at the hotel is simply amazing. It tastes like it has been prepared by any of the good restaurants in india.We had breakfast at enchanted garden (located at hotel disney land which is about 1 km away from hollywood hotel) for 2 days. Enchanted garden has charecter dinning with goofy pluto and mickey of course (as against chef mickey which only had mickey). Breakfast at Enchanted garden is slightly expensive than chef mickey. The breakfast spread at both enchanted garden and chef mickey is good (indian vegetarian). Daal makhani was there ( at both breakfast venues)!!The hotel does not have a shuttle that goes from hollywood hotel to disneyland hotel (the shuttles go from disneyland hotel to hollywood hotel to disney park to disneyland hotel) abd hence we had to walk around 1 km on both the days. The walk was pleasant though but with a small child becomes very slow. Hence please keep 20 mins grace if you are walking from hollywood hotel to enchanted garden. Meeting disney charecters at enchanted gardens is an awesome experience. We enjoyed it a lot. All the 3 charecters were very good and posed for photographs. The staff at enchanted gardens was very helpful.The disney park was an amazing experience as well. We had taken 2 day tickets. Covered all the rides we liked. Our daughter (3.5 years old) enjoyed winnie the pooh, phillar magic, dumbo the elephant, parachute drop, lion king, river safari and skinky dog. Grizzly gulch is a thrilling ride and we will not recommend it for children below 5 years. It has lots of jerks twists and turns at high speed.

I don't know where these people must've been but it can't be Disneyland Paris because it's out of this world, fabulous!The entrance to the Disneyland Park is all fountains and flowers: lovely. Once inside you enter Main Street which is a wonderful old fashioned American street, with lots of quaint looking shops and a bandstand, looking up the street is the beautiful Sleeping Beauty castle.As soon as we arrived we spotted several Disney characters in the street and they signed my daughters' autograph books and had pictures taken with them. There were lots of people around but it was easy enough to get to them. During our stay (in mid August so peak time), we encountered a number of characters around the park, some of them in less busy areas, such as Fantasyland near Casey Jnr's circus train where there were hardly any people crowding them, and around another area in Frontierland I think, somewhere called Woody's roundup village, we met some chipmunks, Donald Duck and Jessie from Toy Story and it was very quiet here.To meet the Princesses it's a bit more difficult but not impossible, they appear several times a day in the bandstand near the entrance and you do have to queue a little while and be a bit forceful, there's no room for being shy and retiring or you'll never get a look in, but having said that we did not really encounter the pushing in etc that other reviewers have commented on.As for the park itself, it is immaculate, there was no litter, people are constantly sweeping the streets, the toilets were clean and full of toilet roll. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the characters exceptionally so. I've never been to the American Disneyland but having now been to Paris, I don't see any need to.The queues for the rides were quite long but that's to be expected at any theme park in peak holidays, and queueing time soon passed. We didn't find Disney Studios as good as Disneyland Park, but maybe it's more for older kids. We all went on Crush's Coaster as my youngest daughter (aged 5) was over the height limit but it was a very fast rollercoaster with spinning cars that frightened her to death, I certainly wouldn't recommend for small kids even if they are over the height restriction. It was pretty scary even for adults.We had prebooked meals with characters at Cafe Mickey which was good and Auberge de Cendrillon which wasn't, and took rolls etc from the self service breakfast in the hotel for lunch, so only had one evening meal to find. We ate at a fast food restaurant near the Star Wars ride as it was the only one with a reasonable sized queue, I'd been expecting to have to pay in the region of 100 Euros having read some reviews on here but it cost 34 Euros for 4 of us including drinks and ice cream. Admittedly it wasn't very good but I think this is what you come to expect, Disneyland is brilliant except for the food.It cost about 3 E for a bottle of pop in the park, the same for a grab sized pack of crisps, and about 3.5E for an ice cream. But we didn't spend that much over our 4 days altogether.If you're having meals with characters, pre book them in the UK as it's cheaper. I would definitely recommend Disneyland, it was a wonderful experience for all of us, a very beautiful place and we can't wait to go back!","Disneyland_Paris"

The rides are great, nothing crazy scary like other theme parks, so I had a ball and got to join in, as I'm not an thrill seeker when it comes to this sort of thing! I thought it was a bit  twee , very old fashioned and proper, but fantastic at the same time if that makes sense.I was surprised at all the dressed up little girls and  bigger girls ! No matter what the age 98% of the females were dressed up or at least wore a version of Minnie's ears. Very cute. In NZ I doubt that many kids would have a clue about the traditional Disney characters, so it was interesting that the park focus was very much these old guys!Picked up a good hint on Trip Advisor about going back to the car parking building to watch the fireworks   a great idea, we weren't the only ones, but very sensible. Unfortunately the fireworks hadn't happened 3 4 hour after they were meant to have started, so we ended up heading out without seeing them which was really disappointing.Plan ahead, work out what you want to do and how best to see everything. Extremely disappointing was the cost of merchandise, absolutely over the top. I was shocked and decided my grandson wouldn't be getting a souvineer from here.

124431513,3,"2012-1","Hong Kong","Apparently, its the smallest Disneyland there is, but hey   when you are less than a meter tall and all your favourite cartoons are walking around you, who cares?!We got to see a few princesses (whose identity were lost on me but not on my little friends). They got hungry quickly so it was kinda good and cool that the maps actually listed out every single thing that was available in the park and which corner. (ie. you can get cotton candy candy floss at the left corner of Fantasyland and if you prefer waffles instead, there is a specific streetcart you can get it at such and such a place). This is important because when kids see something and they want it. They want IT and nothing else. So I'm glad it was easy to 'hunt' for the cotton candy.Because it was small I suppose it was less crowded than the one in Florida   I'm not sure, but it meant we got to sit right by the parade and dance with a few mascot characters. This drove my 5 and 2 year old friends completely out of their mind; it was like y'know, the coolest thing ever. At that age....The show in Adventureland scared them out a bit because all the other rides attractions were held outdoors and had bright colourful lights so going straight into a dimly lit auditorium with a huge lion perching and staring at you from the top was pretty scary. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, you have to wait from 30 45 minutes in line for the rides which is a long time if you have kids. Maybe it would be better if one parent stood in line while the kids went somewhere else to run off the sugar instead...","Disneyland_HongKong"

242195863,5,"2014-11","United States","Our two day visit was on ideal because it was a Sunday and Monday in early November. The weather was ideal and lines were reasonable at about an hour for popular attractions. We used the FASTPASS option as often as we could to help reduce our wait time. Search for more information about how it works as it will allow you to enjoy more attractions. Two days were ideal for us to see both parks, Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park, which conveniently share the same entrance. For a little money a park hopper pass allows visiting each park during the same day; however, we saved money by planning ahead and seeing one park each day. Another helpful tool is to install the MouseWait app and use it to gauge which attraction to visit based on the wait times submitted by users. It is not perfect, but it is close since there is no formal Disney sponsored wait time app. An advantage of the app is it can alert you to closed attractions. You can ask any attraction attendant or shop staff to confirm the closure by radio,","Disneyland_California"

Look out for the free fast path tickets that are available around the parks but not widely advertised. Moving between the two parks was easy. California Screaming and the World of Colour show were the highlights. Only criticism is the high price of food and drink, particularly water which is a necessity given the high temperatures.","Disneyland_California"

A little disappointed with the restaurants on site, not the highest quality of food or service, some of the younger staff appear to have a  only here to earn some money attitude  and need to learn a little more about customer service. Stayed at on site hotel  New York  was great, but not really necessary for a second or third visit, used also other hotels on the outskirts that provide a shuttle service to the parks, regular and efficient.","Disneyland_Paris"

I skipped the show except for the parade and firework at night . Most of the ride are ride able for a 2 year old child . Remember to take the time flyers for show if you are catching the show and also ask for the sticker on every ride entrance! Enjoy the day and experience the fun ! I love everything there except the manner that the entrance lady showed. She did not explain that the stroller need to go by the middle entrance and need to scan the entry ticket at the side (either left or right ) before going in the middle and show me some kind of face when I asked her.Went on Monday (non peak season ) so the queue was not that ''long wait'' .p s : Do not feed the bird over the snack stall .","Disneyland_HongKong"

159116044,5,"2013-4","Australia","Disneyland certainly lived up to childhood expectations. I've been waiting 40 years to go to Disneyland and it didn't disappoint. All the rides attractions were amazing and all very special. The attention to detail is beautiful. The fireworks were amazing and the parades were great. I traveled with 2 children (aged 7 and 9) which was the perfect age. We all loved the fun rides   there was not one ride we did not like. Our favourite food locations were Blue Bayou for dinner (amazing atmosphere and food), Cafe Orleans for lunch for a Monte Cristo sandwich) and Bengal BBQ for lunch snack   they have great meat chicken vegetable skewers. I was really impressed that most Disney eating locations have healthy options for kids   all kids meals come with carrots and apples. This was much appreciated.  You will need 2 full days to experience Disneyland and another 1 2 days if you are doing California Adventure Park. Lines were long for some rides. Download the app  MouseWait  which helps you see which rides have long waits. Use this together with the FastPass system to avoid log queues. Though, in some cases, you just have to bite the bullet and queue up! My only complaint is that not all sections of Disneyland were open for the Extra Magic Hour in the morning for guests of Disneyland Parks. Only 2 sections of the park were open early. If meeting the characters is top of your list   book the character breakfasts. We only got to meet the characters because we had the Minnie breakfast. Otherwise, for the characters roaming the park, there is always a line up to meet them. We waited half an hour to meet Tinkerbell .... and she wasn't even there. It was another fairy. At the breakfast, they come to your table and spend a few minutes with you and your family. This was lovely. Also, if you are there for a few days, the PhotoPass system is good. There are photographers around the park who will take your photo and scan your card. This also includes photos taken on the rides and character breakfasts. You can them download them at home. The package cost just over $100. ","Disneyland_California"

We have nothing against Gay Days.. but the crowds made it the busiest weekend of the whole year (based on several Disney employees)..

One kid loved the buzz light year ride so we hit that early most mornings , the other loved the pirates of the carribean so we did that a few times also. Used the steam boat trip to have lunch on one day nice and relaxing. The displays were being changed from winter to spring so a nice change during the week. Didn't use the hire buggies first couple of days but did the last few which enabled us to get about quicker. Food was very varied there is a nice kinda hidden shop of to the right of main street as you go in with nice croque monsieur and bruschette snacks  lunch. We also went to the Buzz light year all you can eat buffett which is good value for money with under 3s free and is hidden at the back of space mountain under the railway. It was very tasty, with lots of choice and fresh fruit ( lacking elsewhere in the park). We enjoyed the parade but you need to get a space early rather than looking at the back of folks heads. The night time laser   fireworks   water display was 20   30 minutes and was really excellent but you probably only need to do it once. A few rides were down for maintenance but we knew about that when we booked on the website, there was plenty to do. Also used the extra hours for the kids to meet the characters in the morning. The queue for meeting mickey mouse at the top of the park has a theatre tv screen inside playing mickey films and was the only queue we joined which was 45 mins but it passed quickly with the kids watching the movie and it was heavily raining outside at that time so a bonus in the dryProbably could benefit from a new ride or 2 like the ratatoullie one next door which was excellent using full use of modern technology but still really enjoyrd ourselves and walked a few miles into the bargain","Disneyland_Paris"

Disneyland Park is the flagship of old Walt's evil plan to take over the world.

Disneyland shamelessly separates rube families from their hard earned cash with shockingly high admission fees, souvenirs made of crap, and junk food at sky high prices. Several of the aging main attractions were broken down when we visited. The implicit message from the parent corporation running this rank obscenity is that you pay through the nose, then get the hell out as soon as possible to make room for more suckers. You won't find a drinking fountain, a shady spot, or a place to sit down anywhere, so be prepared to get exhausted by being on your feet all day and for your kids to go bonkers overdosing on sugary drinks. You'll lucky indeed to avoid getting your toes flattened by one of the bloated legions of  Handicapped,  morbidly obese scooter riders you'll see everywhere who get to crowd to the front of the endless lines at the few rides that are working.

One of the shops tried to over charge me for some toys to which I had to argue and help the cashier count. The parade was a cattle market, nobody walking round trying to keep any sense of order, I lost count of the amount of crying children I saw that had been pushed, shoved and trampled on by fully grown adults barging through to get to the front.

By mid afternoon there were lots of miserable looking boiling people in the queues. The food and drinks are very expensive and make sure you reserve a table for dinner in the evening   it would have been helpful if we had been advised to book for dinner as all the restaurants we tried were full with at least a 60 min wait. We had to leave the park and go to Downtown Disney to try to get food so we didn't miss the parade. We ended up buying a slice of pizza from a very disorganised pizza place   you could only drink a beer inside but there was nowhere to sit! We seriously considered forgetting the parade and fireworks and head back to the hotel as it was getting so difficult. However we stayed and we are glad we did. The parade and the fireworks were great. Tip: get a space with a full view of the castle for the parade and fireworks EARLY   our view of the fireworks was obscured by a tree. Also use the fast pass scheme and avoid the MASSIVE queues. If you want something healthy to snack on go to the market near the Indiana Jones ride   they sell FRUIT!!! But it is expensive.........
